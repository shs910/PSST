The magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes\nthe pulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the\ncurvature radiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron\nradiation with different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the\nlight curves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of\nthe secondary pairs, and the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the\nregion near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows the pair\ncreation to happen with a smaller pitch angle.\n", "q_idx": 9, "question": "What is responsible for the differences between the light curves of different energy bands?", "options": {"A": "The different sizes of the secondary pairs", "B": "The different shapes of the secondary pairs", "C": "Unanswerable", "D": "The different pitch angles of the secondary pairs"}, "correctAnswer": "D"}

{"idx": 20, "passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prospects dimmed on Monday for the U.S. House of Representatives to vote this week on Republican legislation to restrict gun sales to suspected extremists before Congress goes on a seven-week summer break.  Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Congress begins a summer recess on Friday. But with the House floor schedule filling with other bills, Republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before September, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.   Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, “I do not anticipate that bill.” The measure, backed by the National Rifle Association, would give government authorities three days to convince a judge to block the sale of weapons to someone suspected of involvement in violent extremism. But Ryan has been unable to win support from conservative Republicans who say the measure poses potential constitutional problems and should be subjected to regular legislative channels including formal hearings. Republican lawmakers say discussions aimed at finding compromise are continuing. But the measure did not come up at a Monday meeting with Republican leaders to discuss the week’s agenda, said another lawmaker who predicted it would not see a vote this week.   The stalemate leaves hanging Democratic demands for stronger gun restrictions, despite an unprecedented 25-hour sit-in by House Democrats last month, and sidelines any potential movement on an alternative bipartisan bill seen as a possible compromise. “A vote is going to be stalled” until Congress returns from its long summer break, one Republican aide said.

However, the\nstrain in OTM measurements, applied by optically forcing a micro-probe through\nthe material, induces network inhomogeneities in and around the strain path,\nand the resultant flow field complicates the measured response of the system.\nThrough a robust set of custom-designed OTM protocols, coupled with modeling\nand analytical calculations, we characterize the time-varying inhomogeneity\nfields induced by OTM measurements. We show that post-strain homogenization\ndoes not interfere with the intrinsic stress relaxation dynamics of the system,\nrather it manifests as an independent component in the stress decay, even in\nhighly nonlinear regimes such as with the microrheological-LAOS (mLAOS)\nprotocols we introduce. Our specific results show that Rouse-like elastic\nretraction, rather than disentanglement and disengagement, dominates the\nnonlinear stress relaxation of entangled polymers at micro- and meso- scales.\nThus, our study opens up possibilities of performing precision nonlinear\nmicrorheological measurements, such as mLAOS, on a wide range of complex\nmacromolecular systems.\n", "q_idx": 9, "question": "What types of systems can be probed by OTM?", "options": {"A": "Unanswerable", "B": "Gaseous compounds", "C": "Networks of entangled polymers", "D": "Solid metal compounds"}, "correctAnswer": "C"}

In this chapter, we\nexamine the relationship between growth and locations of craft breweries and\nthe incidence of neighborhood change across the United States. In the first\npart of the chapter, we rely on a unique dataset of geocoded brewery locations\nthat tracks openings and closings from 2004 to the present. Using measures of\nneighborhood change often found in literature on gentrification-related topics,\nwe develop statistical models relying on census tract demographic and\nemployment data to determine the extent to which brewery locations are\nassociated with social and demographic shifts since 2000. The strongest\npredictor of whether a craft brewery opened in 2013 or later in a neighborhood\nwas the presence of a prior brewery. We do not find evidence entirely\nconsistent with the common narrative of a link between gentrification and craft\nbrewing, but we see a link between an influx of lower-to-middle income urban\ncreatives and the introduction of a craft breweries.
