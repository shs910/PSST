The highway travels from an interchange with SR 410 in Sumner and travels south along the Puyallup River to Orting and northeast to South Prairie , ending at an intersection with SR 165 near Buckley . SR 162 was established in 1964 as the successor to Secondary State Highway 5E ( SSH 5E ) , which was codified in 1937 . The highway crosses the Puyallup River northwest of Orting on the McMillin Bridge , which opened in 1934 and is scheduled to be replaced with a newer bridge that will begin construction in 2014 .\n\n= = Route description = =\n\nSR 162 begins at a diamond interchange with the SR 410 freeway in Sumner and travels south as a continuation of Valley Avenue , crossing the Puyallup River . The highway continues south through rural Pierce County , following a Ballard Terminal Railroad line and the Puyallup River . It serves the community of Alderton and joins the Pierce County Foothills Trail , traveling southeast from Puyallup . SR 162 crosses the Puyallup River on the McMillin Bridge , listed on the National Register of Historical Places , west of its confluence with the Carbon River . It becomes Washington Avenue as it travels southeast through Orting , serving Orting High School . The highway turns southwest onto Bridge Street and crosses the Foothills Trail before turning back southeast onto Herman Way , later Pioneer Way outside of Orting , towards South Prairie . SR 162 continues northeast , crossing the Foothills Trail and the Carbon River before passing through South Prairie . The highway travels east , crossing South Prairie Creek and passing White River High School , before ending at an intersection with SR 165 southwest of Buckley .\nEvery year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that between 4 @,@ 100 and 21 @,@ 000 vehicles per day used the highway , mostly between Sumner and Orting .\n\n= = History = =\n\nSR 162 was codified as SSH 5E during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 , beginning at Primary State Highway 5 ( PSH 5 ) and U.S. Route 410 in Puyallup , traveling through Orting and South Prairie to end at an intersection with a branch of PSH 5 southwest of Buckley . SSH 5E had a branch that traveled south from Orting to Electron that was removed from the state highway system in 1955 . The highway traveled across the Puyallup River into Orting on the McMillin Bridge , which opened in 1934 as a concrete half @-@ through truss bridge to save the Department of Highways a total of $ 826 . SR 165 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering and was codified in 1970 as the replacement to SSH 5E . The western terminus , now at SR 410 , was moved east to an interchange in Sumner after the completion of the Sumner Freeway in 1972 . The McMillin Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as an example of a half @-@ through truss bridge built with concrete instead of steel . The route of the highway has not seen a major revision since 1972 ; however , WSDOT repaved the roadway and added guardrails between Orting and Buckley in 2008 . The deteriorating McMillin Bridge is being replaced by WSDOT with a newer , wider span over the Puyallup River scheduled to begin construction in 2014 .\n\n= = Major intersections = =\n\nThe entire highway is in Pierce County .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "= Problem of Apollonius =\n\nIn Euclidean plane geometry , Apollonius 's problem is to construct circles that are tangent to three given circles in a plane ( Figure 1 ) . Apollonius of Perga ( ca . 262 BC â ca . 190 BC ) posed and solved this famous problem in his work á¼ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î¯ ( EpaphaÃ­ , \" Tangencies \" ) ; this work has been lost , but a 4th @-@ century report of his results by Pappus of Alexandria has survived . Three given circles generically have eight different circles that are tangent to them ( Figure 2 ) and each solution circle encloses or excludes the three given circles in a different way : in each solution , a different subset of the three circles is enclosed ( its complement is excluded ) and there are 8 subsets of a set whose cardinality is 3 , since 8 = 23 .\nIn the 16th century , Adriaan van Roomen solved the problem using intersecting hyperbolas , but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions . FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases : any of the three given circles can be shrunk to zero radius ( a point ) or expanded to infinite radius ( a line ) . ViÃ¨te 's approach , which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones , is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius ' method . The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton , who showed that Apollonius ' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points . This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN .\nLater mathematicians introduced algebraic methods , which transform a geometric problem into algebraic equations . These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries inherent in the problem of Apollonius : for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs , with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes ( Figure 2 ) . Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution , while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify the configuration of the given circles . These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods ( using Lie sphere geometry ) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles .\nApollonius ' problem has stimulated much further work . Generalizations to three dimensions â constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres â and beyond have been studied . The configuration of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention . RenÃ© Descartes gave a formula relating the radii of the solution circles and the given circles , now known as Descartes ' theorem . Solving Apollonius ' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket , which is one of the earliest fractals to be described in print , and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy â Littlewood circle method .\n\n= = Statement of the problem = =\n\nThe general statement of Apollonius ' problem is to construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane , where an object may be a line , a point or a circle of any size . These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another ; however , they are usually taken to be distinct , meaning that they do not coincide . Solutions to Apollonius ' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles , although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius .\nThe property of tangency is defined as follows . First , a point , line or circle is assumed to be tangent to itself ; hence , if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects , it is counted as a solution to Apollonius ' problem . Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common . By definition , a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them , that is , if it lies on them ; thus , two distinct points cannot be tangent . If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero , they are said to be tangent ; the intersection point is called a tangent point or a point of tangency . ( The word \" tangent \" derives from the Latin present participle , tangens , meaning \" touching \" . ) In practice , two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point ; if they intersect at zero or two points , they are not tangent . The same holds true for a line and a circle . Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane , although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry ( see below ) .\nThe solution circle may be either internally or externally tangent to each of the given circles . An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact ; they lie on opposite sides of the tangent line at that point , and they exclude one another . The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii . By contrast , an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact ; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line , and one circle encloses the other . In this case , the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii . As an illustration , in Figure 1 , the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium @-@ sized given black circle on the right , whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left .\nApollonius ' problem can also be formulated as the problem of locating one or more points such that the differences of its distances to three given points equal three known values . Consider a solution circle of radius rs and three given circles of radii r1 , r2 and r3 . If the solution circle is externally tangent to all three given circles , the distances between the center of the solution circle and the centers of the given circles equal d1",

        "src_passage": "MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s leader pledged to press ahead with his independence bid if Spain moves to suspend the region s autonomy, a regional government source said on Wednesday, hours before a deadline over keeping the euro zone s fourth-largest economy united. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given Catalan president Carles Puigdemont until 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday to renounce a secession bid which has rocked markets and rattled the euro, or face direct rule from Madrid. Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence last week and promptly suspended it to ask for talks with Madrid. The source said he would now lift that suspension if Rajoy exercised so-called Article 155 of the Constitution to take back power.  The president said (at) his party s meeting that he will lift the suspension of the independence declaration if the government executes Article 155,  the source said. That article, which has never been used during Spain s four decades of democracy, allows central government to take over any of its 17 autonomous communities if they break the law, which Madrid says Catalonia has done by holding a referendum on independence and pushing for a break-up. Even though it is not clear what direct rule will look like, the prospect has raised fears that social unrest could add to the turbulence, on the heels of an exodus of hundreds of Catalan firms and cuts to economic growth forecasts.  In the latest grim prediction, Spain s independent budget watchdog warned this week that continued uncertainty could wipe as much as 12 billion euros off potential economic growth next year, cutting forecasts by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points. Catalonia accounts for 20 percent of Spain s GDP. If Rajoy triggers the article on Thursday, it will take between three and five days for the government in the wealthy region to be effectively stripped of its powers.   If autonomy is suspended we will have to move in a hurry,  the source said.  Disappointed that last week s declaration was merely symbolic, pro-independence parties in Puigdemont s ruling coalition are now pushing for a formal vote in the Catalan parliament. Earlier on Wednesday, Rajoy urged Puigdemont to  act sensibly  and scrap the bid or risk direct rule, a move which would need only a vote in Spain s upper house, where Rajoy s People s Party holds an absolute majority. The premier repeated a call for clarity on the matter.  It s not that difficult to reply to the question: Has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not, we can talk here,  Rajoy said in parliament.    A central government source later said Madrid viewed a formal independence declaration as  unacceptable blackmail . Since an Oct. 1 independence referendum which Madrid branded illegal, some 700 companies have moved their head offices from Catalonia, according to Spain s companies registry. Despite a violent crackdown by Spanish police to thwart the vote, Catalan officials say 43 percent of voters still managed to cast ballots in the referendum with 90 percent in favor of breaking away.  Banco Sabadell, Spain s fifth-biggest bank, is considering moving its top management to Madrid. Tourism, a vital part of the Catalan economy centred on its seaside capital Barcelona, has also taken a hit, with activity falling 15 percent so far this month, industry association Exceltur said on Tuesday. The region s tourism industry could make 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) less than usual in the fourth quarter  if the volatility and confrontation get worse in the coming months , Exceltur said in a statement. Authoritative Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia reported that Madrid plans to appoint its own delegates to run regional government departments. Puigdemont would remain nominally in his role but stripped of all powers. Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said last week that it was not clear what measures the government would take if direct rule were imposed, but said the government would work on it.  La Vanguardia said Puigdemont, a 54-year-old former journalist, was mulling declaring independence and calling so-called constituent elections for the newly declared republic. But Catalan foreign affairs chief Raul Romeva told a news conference in Brussels:  Elections are not on the table now.  Tempers have flared since the jailing on Monday of two separatist leaders, pending an investigation for alleged sedition.  Tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona s Diagonal Avenue on Tuesday to call for their release, whistling and shouting  freedom  and  out with the occupying forces . ",

        "src_passage": "PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States must step up its support for a planned African force to fight Islamist militants in West Africa or it could fail, leaving French troops to carry the burden alone, France s defense minister said on Friday. France intervened in Mali to ward off an offensive by Islamist militants that began in 2012, and 4,000 of its troops remain in the region as part of Operation Barkhane where they work alongside 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Mali. France and West African countries are pushing for the creation of a regional force known as the G5 Sahel.   Washington provides bilateral assistance, intelligence and training for regional security operations. But it is cool towards the African force and has pushed back against U.N. support for it. President Donald Trump s administration has also come under intense scrutiny over its existing operations in West Africa after an ambush in Niger in early October saw four U.S. soldiers killed by jihadists, in what experts say appears to have been an intelligence failure.  In the Sahel, France is deploying in a high-intensity environment, with tremendous support from the United States. We are immensely grateful for that support,  French Defence Minister Florence Parly said in a speech at a Washington think tank monitored in Paris.  But much more needs to be done. We can t be, and don t want to be, the praetorian (guards) of sovereign African countries. They must be made able to defeat terror on their own,  she said during a visit for meetings with her American counterpart James Mattis and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.  I would be happy if you could help spread the word in the Beltway,  she said in a reference to the U.S. government. Still, discussion in Washington was focused more on what went wrong with the Niger operation. The deadly incident has become a political football in Washington amid criticism of Trump s handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers.  The U.S. military is investigating the incident, and the FBI said it was assisting  as it has done in the past when American citizens are killed overseas.    Hours after Parly s visit to the Pentagon, Mattis visited Capitol Hill to meet Senator John McCain, who threatened to issue a subpoena to get information about the ambush in Niger after complaining about being kept in the dark.  After their talks, Mattis acknowledged that  we can always improve on communication,  remarks echoed by McCain, the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  We have had our problems and issues. But I m proud to work with him, and I m proud of the work that he is doing,  McCain said. From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles. Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead. French aircraft evacuated the wounded, but the body of one of the dead soldiers was recovered by Nigerien soldiers only after two days. The U.S. military s Africa Command issued a statement on Friday explaining that the 800 U.S. military personnel in Niger were on a mission supporting African forces.  The U.S. military does not have an active, direct combat mission in Niger,  it said.  LONG-TERM  EXIT STRATEGY? Parly said the G5 Sahel force was meant to bolster the security capacity of Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania, which are all former French colonies.  French officials see the success of the G5 Sahel as a long-term exit strategy for Paris. For decades, France has mounted military operations in its former African colonies but in recent years it has looked to spread the cost. Until now the G5 force has only received a quarter of its estimated 423 million euro budget, according to a report by the U.N. Secretary General, who said financing the operation would  remain a significant challenge  for several years.   It will start its first operations soon. It needs support. The U.N. wants to give support. I hope everyone can become convinced that a robust U.N. assistance is necessary,  Parly said. French defense officials say they expect the first G5 patrols to begin this month and hope that will provide momentum ahead of a donor conference in December. ",

        "src_passage": "= Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance =\n\nThe Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance was an honor presented to female recording artists at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 and the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 for quality rap solo performances . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \" honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position \" .\nIn 1991 , the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Best Rap Solo Performance category . In 2003 , the category was split into two to recognize Female and Male Rap Solo Performances . The categories remained separated by gender until 2005 when they were combined into the genderless category originally called Best Rap Solo Performance . American artist Missy Elliott won the award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance both years it was presented .\n\n= = Background = =\n\nIn 1991 , the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance category . The category name remained unchanged until 2004 when it was split into separate categories for Female and Male Rap Solo Performance . The categories remained separated by gender for one additional year . In 2005 , they were merged into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance . Female rapper MC Lyte has campaigned for the reinstatement of the female @-@ specific category and believes that : \" it destroys [ hip @-@ hop ] culture to not have the perspective of a woman \" . Bill Freimuth , Recording Academy Vice President of Awards , claimed that the category was eliminated because \" [ there ] wasn 't enough competition essentially , due to the lack of the number of releases in that category \" . Black Entertainment Television ( BET ) executive Stephen Hill cited a similar reason for the elimination of the female categories by the BET Hip Hop Awards and VH1 's Hip Hop Honors , reflecting a lack of female representation in the hip hop music scene for several years . As of 2011 , the category name has not changed since 2005 .\n\n= = Recipients = =\n\nFor the 45th Grammy Awards ( 2003 ) , Best Female Rap Solo Performance nominees included : Charli Baltimore for \" Diary ... \" , Missy Elliott for \" Scream a.k.a. Itchin ' \" , Eve for \" Satisfaction \" , Foxy Brown for \" Na Na Be Like \" , and Lauryn Hill for \" Mystery of Iniquity \" . Baltimore was shocked when she learned of her album 's nomination because she thought that it did not meet eligibility requirements . Elliott was also nominated for Best Short Form Music Video , along with Knoc @-@ turn 'al and Dr. Dre , for \" Knoc \" . The award was presented to Elliott at Madison Square Garden in New York City , though not broadcast on television .\nNominees for the 46th Grammy Awards included : Da Brat for \" Got It Poppin ' \" , Elliott for \" Work It \" , Lil ' Kim for \" Came Back for You \" , MC Lyte for \" Ride Wit Me \" , and Queen Latifah for \" Go Head \" . In addition , Elliott was nominated for : Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for Under Construction , Best Song Rap for \" Work It \" , and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \" Gossip Folks \" ( featuring Ludacris ) , for a total five nominations . Lil ' Kim was also nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \" Can 't Hold Us Down \" ( with Christina Aguilera ) and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \" Magic Stick \" ( featuring 50 Cent ) . The award was presented to Elliott for \" Work It \" , whose music video was awarded Video of the Year and Best Hip @-@ Hop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards .\nElliott won the award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance both years it was presented . Prior to the female and male categories , she received the award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 2002 for \" Get Ur Freak On \" . This marked the second time a female had received the award for Best Rap Solo Performance ( Queen Latifah was presented the honor for \" U.N.I.T.Y. \" at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995 ) . In 2007 , following the return to the genderless category , Elliot was nominated for the song \" We Run This \" .\n\n",

The non @-@ profit company is based in Trondheim , where it shares offices with its parent company Uninett ; both companies being owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research . Norid operates under contract with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority , supervised by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority . Uninett took over responsibility for the Norwegian domain in 1987 , and in 2003 it was spun off as a separate company . Only .no is open for registration .\n\n= = History = =\n\nThe registry for .no was in 1983 given to PÃ¥l Spilling at the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration 's research institute . However , policy @-@ makers wanted the domain to be managed by a non @-@ commercial organization , and the responsibility was transferred to Uninett , a supplier of information and communications technology to Norwegian public universities , colleges and research institutions , on 17 March 1987 . At the time Uninett was administrated as a division of SINTEF , but became a limited company owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research in 1993 . Norid was established as a division within Uninett in 1996 , with the responsibility of managing the .no domain . On 21 August 1997 , Norid was given the responsibility for the newly created .sj and .bv domains . In 1998 , Uninett FAS was established as a subsidiary to manage the technical network and service infrastructure Uninett had established , including operation of the network systems for the universities and colleges . At the same time , Norid was transferred to Uninett FAS . In 1998 , two organizations were established : the Domain Resolution Body , to determine domain disputes , and Norpol , a political advisory board . Domain name registrars were introduced in 1999 to handle aspects that could be provided by a third party . Uninett Norid was made a separate subsidiary of Uninett in 2003 , to secure the management of the domains within an independent organization .\n\n= = Organization = =\n\nUninett Norid AS is a limited company wholly owned by Uninett , a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research . The offices are co @-@ located with Uninett in Trondheim . Norid manages three country ccTLDs : .no , .sj and .bv. The former is the main domain for Norway , and the latter two are not open for registration . The legal right to manage the domains is two @-@ fold , based both on an agreement with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) and regulations via the Telecommunication Act which is supervised by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority . In 2009 , the company had a revenue of 23 @.@ 1 million Norwegian krone . Norid is a member of the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries .\n\n= = Policy = =\n\nThe policy for use of the domains is regulated by the Regulation Concerning Domain Names Under Norwegian Country Code Top @-@ level Domains , also known as the Domain Regulation . This regulation also regulates .bv and .sj , and would be effective for these , should they later come unto use .\nOnly organizations with a local presence in Norway and with registration in the BrÃ¸nnÃ¸ysund Register Centre are allowed to register domains under .no. Each organization can register 100 directly under the .no domain , but can register further domains under geographical domains or category second @-@ level domains . Domain names must consist of 2 to 63 characters . Permitted characters are the lower @-@ case English letters a through z , digits ( 0 through 9 ) , the three Norwegian letter Ã¦ , Ã¸ and Ã¥ , and 20 special Sami letters . Norid also maintains a series of second @-@ level domains for geographic locations and special institutions . There is also a series of domain names that cannot be registered .\nThe domains .bv and .sj remain reserved for potential future use . Sale of the two unused ccTLDs has not been an item to consider for policymakers , as commercialization of the domain resources is in direct contradiction to Norwegian policy .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "= The Little Hero of Holland =\n\nThe Little Hero of Holland is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . It is an adaptation of the short fictional story popularized in Hans Brinker , or The Silver Skates , about a boy who plugs a leaking dike with his finger to prevent it from bursting . The role of the boy was played by Marie Eline , but little else is known about the production and cast of the film . The director may have been Barry O 'Neil and the writer may have been Lloyd Lonergan . Parts of the film were shot on Glen Park Island in New Rochelle , New York . The film was released on June 17 , 1910 and saw a wide release , including the United Kingdom . The film is presumed lost .\n\n= = Plot = =\n\nThough the film is presumed lost , a synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18 , 1910 . It states : \" Hans is a little Dutch boy , the son of a poor fisherman . He , like all children of Holland , is early impressed with the fact that the safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike . He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening . Walking along the foot of the dike , he discovers a tiny hole , through which the water is pouring . Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture , the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village , he sticks his tiny finger in the hole , and waits for someone to come to his assistance . Night comes on . His family decided he has stayed with his aunt , and do not worry about him . In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure , by his little sister who has been searching for him . She runs back and notifies the villagers , who come to his assistance , repair the dike , and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph . He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister . By his night 's heroism he has made himself a place in history , and will always be known as ' the little hero of Holland . ' \"\n\n= = Production = =\n\nThe writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser , averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915 . The film was an adaptation of the fictional story that was popularized in Hans Brinker , or The Silver Skates . The name of the boy , Hans , may be a reference to the erroneous association to unnamed character in the book . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . Many of the scenes for the film were shot at Glen Park in New Rochelle , New York .\nOnly Marie Eline 's credit as Hans , the young boy , is credited . Eline had previously played an Italian boy in The Two Roses . The other members cast may have included the leading players of the Thanhouser productions , Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane . Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company . Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser .\n\n= = Release = =\n\nThe single reel drama , approximate 650 feet long , was released on June 17 , 1910 . Some trade publications list the length of the film as 1000 feet though . The United Kingdom release of the film may have had the name of the hero changed to Peter . A synopsis in The Bioscope on October 27 , 1910 refers to the hero by the name Peter . This alternative name for the hero of the story can be found in the 1910 publication of Reader 1st @-@ 4th by D. Appleton and Company . A review in The Moving Picture World was neutral because it lacked specific praise or criticism of the production . The film had a wide release , advertisements for the showing in theaters include those in Pennsylvania , Oklahoma , Indiana , and Missouri . The film is presumed lost .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Republicans tried to repeal and replace Obamacare over the summer, they acted like “a bunch of free range chickens”, said Republican Senator John Kennedy. “Everybody was upset, tired, mad, people drawing lines in the dirt.” Not this time. Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the rest of his party’s Senate leadership brought party members into line this week and finally won passage of a sweeping tax overhaul early on Saturday. Late arm-twisting and deal-sweeteners for wavering lawmakers allowed them to push through legislation that aims to slash corporate taxes and cut personal taxes. Democrats complained it was a bad deal for middle-class and poor Americans and would irresponsibly raise the national debt by $1.4 trillion over the next decade. But they were outnumbered and Republicans’ discipline, in short supply for much of this year, saw the bill through.   The debate revealed how the Republican Party is undergoing a transformation under President Donald Trump. Republicans who fight above all for a balanced budget no longer wield the power they once had.  “I feel somewhat like a dinosaur,” deficit hawk Bob Corker admitted on Friday afternoon. Hours later, he was the only Republican to vote against the bill. Fear also played a role. The risk of a backlash from wealthy donors and conservative supporters if the party failed to deliver on another campaign promise ahead of mid-term elections next year helped party leaders get the legislation approved in a 51-49 vote. “I think after failing twice on healthcare, folks went back home and talked to the real people of America,” said Kennedy. “And they were told, ‘Look, we sent you up there to fix our problems. Fix them or we’ll find somebody who will.’” McConnell needed 50 of the 52 Republicans in the Senate to back the tax bill, knowing Vice President Mike Pence was on hand to provide the tie-breaking vote if needed. McConnell could only count on 43 votes on Wednesday night. Nine other Republican members were wobbly and he had no support from Senate Democrats.  McConnell and his allies went to work, offering a wide range  of late concessions to holdouts to get a political victory after months of frustration.  The bill still needs to be reconciled with a different version approved by the House of Representatives, but the Senate bill is expected to remain largely intact. Led by Corker and Jeff Flake, a small group of fiscal conservatives were at first upset that the Senate bill was going to increase fiscal deficits and the national debt. Early efforts to get their support went slowly. “It’s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. We’re going to keep working on it, as we always have, and we’ll get to the finish line,” Senator Orrin Hatch said on Thursday night. Flake came around when he was able to win two concessions. First, he got a commitment from Senate leadership and the Trump administration to put a time limit on allowing companies to write off the full value of new capital investments. Second, Pence assured Flake the administration would work with him on fair and permanent protections for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. Two other fiscal conservatives, James Lankford and Jerry Moran, also came on board. Although Corker refused to yield, the others’ votes were enough to ensure victory.   Senator Ron Johnson demanded and won amendments to further ease the tax burden on “pass-through” businesses. “I was just kind of biding my time ... And then Senator Portman came over and said ‘What can we do’?”, Johnson said of a Thursday night vote.     Even moderate Senator Susan Collins, who helped scuttle Obamacare repeal efforts earlier this year, agreed to vote in favor of the tax bill.  Representing voters with a high state tax burden in Maine, Collins was against her party’s plan to end the deduction of state and local property taxes. Under an amendment she pushed, taxpayers would be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 a year.  Collins also said she was assured by Republican leaders that they would take steps soon to mitigate damage caused by the repeal of a fee linked to the Obamacare “individual mandate”, which requires some Americans to buy health insurance.  McConnell also got lucky in that Trump didn’t make his job any harder. Unlike his conduct in the Obamacare debate, Trump largely stayed on message, proclaiming the tax bill would help the middle class and businesses. Although incorrect, he also claimed it would be the biggest tax cut ever. Trump met with Republican senators on Capitol Hill for lunch this week, a gathering described as thoughtful and positive. “Nobody called anybody names or talked about anybody’s native American heritage, or anything,” said Kennedy, referring to Trump’s habit of picking fights with perceived enemies. Democrats were furious, saying Republicans were throwing money at the rich and that the bill was handled too fast. “If the economy grows or shrinks. If it creates jobs or loses them. Who knows? Certainly no one here. No one could know, because it hasn’t even been read, let alone thoughtfully considered,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Shumer.     ",

        "src_passage": "SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s governor on Wednesday signed an emergency bill allowing the government to halt payments on its debt, throwing into doubt broader restructuring plans to stave off a financial collapse of the U.S. territory. The measure, which earlier passed Puerto Rico’s legislature, lets Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary and could alter the structure of the Government Development Bank (GDB), the island’s primary fiscal agent.  “This legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs — providing essential services to our people — without fear of retribution,” Garcia Padilla said in a statement. Puerto Rico, burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay, a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, faces economic collapse without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors. Wednesday’s emergency law was rushed into existence as the GDB faces possible default on a $422 million debt payment due on May 1. Garcia Padilla had said he would consider a debt moratorium ahead of that deadline. GDB and its creditors are trying to work out a consensual restructuring. But the new law could spark “a new era of litigation” from creditors, said Daniel Hanson, an analyst with Height Securities. “We believe the overwhelming majority of Puerto Rican issuers have violated their creditors’ rights,” he said in a Wednesday note. Some GDB creditors on Monday sued to prevent a run on the bank, asking a federal court to block depositors from taking out their money while talks continue. The passage of the law drew a quick rebuke from some creditors. Stephen Spencer, a financial adviser to bondholders including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers, said it might violate the terms of a prior restructuring deal at PREPA, the island’s power utility. That deal, under which creditors agreed to take 15 percent repayment cuts, “should be explicitly preserved, rather than being cast into a state of uncertainty,” Spencer said in a statement. He said the law could “close the door to anyone extending new credit to Puerto Rico, seriously impeding its ability to meet citizens’ needs.” In a statement on Wednesday night, PREPA Executive Director Javier Quintana Mendez said the agreement “remains in place and should not be negatively affected by the new law.”  “We continue working in collaboration with our creditors, focused on the implementation of our recovery plan,” Quintana said. A second group of creditors holding debt issued by Puerto Rico’s sales tax authority, COFINA, expressed support for the debt freeze bill, citing delays in legislative efforts by federal lawmakers in Washington to address Puerto Rico’s crisis. “With entrenched private institutions obstructing the legislative process in Washington, it is understandable that Puerto Rican leaders are taking steps to equip the island with the tools it needs,” Susheel Kirpalani, counsel to the COFINA Senior Bondholders Group at law firm Quinn Emanuel, said.    A rescue bill being drafted by the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee so far uses U.S. bankruptcy rules as guidance for a solution, something many creditors oppose. Hearings are expected next week in Washington.   Relations between Puerto Rico and its creditors are growing tenser as major debt payments in May and July loom.  On Tuesday, some of Puerto Rico’s general obligation bondholders criticized the debt moratorium law, at the time still being debated by lawmakers, saying Puerto Rico was ignoring their offer to restructure debt by extending principal payments. Garcia Padilla appeared to fire back on Wednesday, saying “our creditors have engaged in public relations efforts that contain falsehoods about their proposed ‘fixes’ – all of which are aimed at misinforming the public and dissuading Congress from doing what is right for our 3.5 million American citizens.” Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 GO bond 74514LE86=MSRB is down sharply since talk of a debt moratorium bill surfaced earlier this week. On Wednesday the bond fell 2.45 points in price to bid 63.299, yielding 13.33 percent, according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data.  “Puerto Rico’s problems stopped being legal problems and they’ve started being a math problem... at the end of the day Puerto Rico can’t pay,” said Nicholas Venditti, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, speaking at a luncheon for reporters in New York.

        "src_passage": " PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Tom Westerman voted for Donald Trump in last year’s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies.  “It really upset me,” said Westerman, 63, a self-described “middle-class guy” with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.  Westerman’s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.  Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.  Some insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obama’s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.  “It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,” said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.  Westerman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughter’s college tuition. “He says he’s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?”  A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump has called subsidy payments a “gift” for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.  Some people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.  “I support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,” said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.  “Forget the president – it’s the Congress’s responsibility. They’re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,” Heuring said.  In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.  On Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.  Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trump’s cutoff is settled in court.  The moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.  MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE  If the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  These include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.  Karyn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.  Feit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among America’s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.  Her current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trump’s decision.  “The first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,” said Feit, a Democrat.  Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.  “It is a concern obviously,” Lewis said.

        "src_passage": "= Î± , rk â 1 =\nÎ² , and every remainder is strictly smaller than its predecessor , | rk | < | rk â 1 | . The first difference is that the quotients and remainders are themselves Gaussian integers , and thus are complex numbers . The quotients qk are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio ( such as the complex number Î± / Î² ) to the nearest integers . The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be \" smaller \" than another . To do this , a norm function f ( u + vi ) = u2 + v2 is defined , which converts every Gaussian integer u + vi into a normal integer . After each step k of the Euclidean algorithm , the norm of the remainder f ( rk ) is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder , f ( rk â 1 ) . Since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases with every step , the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps . The final nonzero remainder is the gcd ( Î± , Î² ) , the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both Î± and Î² ; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit , Â± 1 or Â± i .\nMany of the other applications of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers . For example , it can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for Gaussian integers ; continued fractions of Gaussian integers can also be defined .\n\n= = = Euclidean domains = = =\n\nA set of elements under two binary operations , + and â , is called a Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and , roughly speaking , if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them . The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic ; rather , they can be more general , such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid . Nevertheless , these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic , such as commutativity , associativity and distributivity .\nThe generalized Euclidean algorithm requires a Euclidean function , i.e. , a mapping f from R into the set of nonnegative integers such that , for any two nonzero elements a and b in R , there exist q and r in R such that a\n= qb + r and f ( r ) < f ( b ) . An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above . The function f can be the magnitude of the number , or the degree of a polynomial . The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably ; hence , if f can be reduced only a finite number of times , the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps . This principle relies heavily on the natural well @-@ ordering of the non @-@ negative integers ; roughly speaking , this requires that every non @-@ empty set of non @-@ negative integers has a smallest member .\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic applies to any Euclidean domain : Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements . Any Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain ( UFD ) , although the converse is not true . The Euclidean domains and the UFD 's are subclasses of the GCD domains , domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists . In other words , a greatest common divisor may exist ( for all pairs of elements in a domain ) , although it may not be possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm . A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain ( PID ) , an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal . Again , the converse is not true : not every PID is a Euclidean domain .\nThe unique factorization of Euclidean domains is useful in many applications . For example , the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat 's theorem on sums of two squares . Unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of Fermat 's Last Theorem published in 1847 by Gabriel LamÃ© , the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid 's algorithm , based on a suggestion of Joseph Liouville . LamÃ© 's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form x + Ïy , where x and y are integers , and Ï =\ne2iÏ / n is an nth root of 1 , that is , Ïn = 1 . Although this approach succeeds for some values of n ( such as n = 3 , the Eisenstein integers ) , in general such numbers do not factor uniquely . This failure of unique factorization in some cyclotomic fields led Ernst Kummer to the concept of ideal numbers and , later , Richard Dedekind to ideals .\n\n= = = = Unique factorization of quadratic integers = = = =\n\nThe quadratic integer rings are helpful to illustrate Euclidean domains . Quadratic integers are generalizations of the Gaussian integers in which the imaginary unit i is replaced by a number Ï . Thus , they have the form u + v Ï , where u and v are integers and Ï has one of two forms , depending on a parameter D. If D does not equal a multiple of four plus one , then\n<formula>\nIf , however , D does equal a multiple of four plus one , then\n<formula>\nIf the function f corresponds to a norm function , such as that used to order the Gaussian integers above , then the domain is known as norm @-@ Euclidean . The norm @-@ Euclidean rings of quadratic integers are exactly those where D",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump set the tone for a tense first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week by tweeting on Thursday that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses.  The White House said Trump would host Xi next Thursday and Friday at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. It said Trump and his wife, Melania, would host Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a dinner next Thursday. In a tweet on Thursday evening, Trump said the highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies, which is also expected to cover differences over North Korea and China’s strategic ambitions in the South China Sea, “will be a very difficult one.” “We can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses,” he wrote, adding in apparent reference to U.S. firms manufacturing in China: “American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.” Despite a string of U.S.-China meetings and conversations that have appeared aimed at mending ties after strong criticism of China by Trump during his election campaign, U.S. officials have said the Republican president will not pull his punches in the meeting.     General Electric Co Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt urged Trump on Thursday to maintain the country’s economic relationship with China, saying the United States had much to gain from globalization. “The country loses if we don’t trade. The relationship with China is key,” Immelt told an aviation panel hosted by industry group the Wings Club. “If you give up on trade, you give up on the best lever that the president of the United States has in negotiating around the world. I just think that President Trump is too smart to give up on that.” The U.S. Commerce Department said earlier that Beijing must change its trade practices and the way its state enterprises operate. “China and others need to realize the games are over – continuing their unfair trade practices and operation as a non-market economy will have serious consequences,” it said. The department said it was launching a new review of China’s status as a non-market economy, which allows the United States  to maintain high anti-dumping duties on cheap Chinese imports, but the designation is widely expected to remain in place.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang stressed the need to see the big picture while fostering mutual trade interests. “The market dictates that interests between our two countries are structured so that you will always have me and I will always have you,” he told a regular briefing. “Both sides should work together to make the cake of mutual interest bigger and not simply seek fairer distribution.” Trump administration officials say the need for China to do more to rein in the nuclear and missile programs of its neighbor and ally North Korea will top the agenda, along with trade. The U.S. side is also expected to criticize Beijing for its pursuit of expansive claims in the South China Sea. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing the meeting would be an opportunity for Trump “to develop a relationship in person with President Xi.” “He’s spoken to him on the phone a few times, but we have big problems ... everything from the South China Sea, to trade, to North Korea. There are big issues of national and economic security that need to get addressed.” Asked if the administration had a vision, or a description for its China policy like the “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia touted by former President Barack Obama, Spicer said: “Right now we’re not worried so much about slogans as much as progress. “There’s a lot of big things that we need to accomplish with China, and I think that we will - we will work on them.” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson agreed in Beijing this month to work with China on North Korea and stressed Trump’s desire to enhance understanding.  China has been irritated at being told repeatedly by Washington to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, or face U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses trading with North Korea, and by the U.S. decision to base an advanced missile defense system in South Korea. Beijing is also deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions toward self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, after Trump, as president-elect, broke with decades of U.S. policy by taking a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and saying Washington did not have to stick to a “one China” policy. Trump later agreed in a phone call with Xi to honor the long-standing policy and has also written to him since seeking “constructive ties.” ",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As she waits for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law, Amy Hagstrom-Miller said she hopes she will not have to close up to three of the clinics she operates in the state, but is planning for it just in case.     Hagstrom-Miller founded Whole Woman’s Health, which runs four facilities in Texas that provide abortions and led the legal challenge to the law. She said she has spreadsheets listing staffers who would be laid off if the court allows the law to survive, and is thinking about selling buildings and medical equipment as well as shutting her clinics in Fort Worth, San Antonio and McAllen.     “I would be irresponsible if I didn’t plan,” Hagstrom-Miller said in an interview. The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on whether the Texas law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman’s constitutional right to end her pregnancy as set out in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The court has not issued a major abortion-related ruling since 2007.     The law requires abortion doctors to have “admitting privileges,” a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. That provision has been implemented. A second provision, not yet in effect, requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities including extensive standards for such attributes as corridor width, room size, floor tiles and the swinging motion of doors. Supporters of the law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013, say it was enacted to protect women’s health.     Abortion rights advocates say it imposes medically unnecessary regulations intended to shut clinics and has dramatically reduced access to abortion in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people. Getting a clear-cut ruling is complicated by the fact that the court is down to eight justices, split evenly with four conservatives and four liberals, following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia. One possibility is a 4-4 split that would affirm a lower court’s decision upholding the law but would not set a national legal precedent that could guide other states eager to pass similar statutes. Because it is unlikely one of the court’s liberals would join the four conservatives, there is almost no chance of a  broad ruling upholding the law and giving other states a green light to enact similar measures. Numerous Republican-governed states have considered measures that would restrict abortion availability. For abortion opponents, who no longer have Scalia to cast a fifth vote to tip the balance in their favor, a 4-4 split leaving the Texas law in place may be the best result possible. John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in California, an abortion opponent who filed a brief with the high court backing the Texas law, said if the justices cannot deliver a decisive ruling, “It’s not a catastrophe.” “I’d rather have women’s health and safety in some parts of the country than no parts of the country,” Eastman said. Legal fights over similar laws are ongoing in several states, including Mississippi, Louisiana and Wisconsin.     If the court leaves in place the lower-court ruling upholding the Texas law, the number of abortion clinics in the state would drop from the current 19 to nine, abortion providers said. Texas had 41 abortion clinics when the law was passed.     “A 4-4 decision would leave us in the untenable situation where a woman’s ability to get an abortion will depend on where she lives,” said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes restrictive abortion laws.      Another possibility is that the justices strike down the law, or invalidate one of the two provisions at issue while keeping the other. It may be more likely that the admitting-privileges provision, already in effect, would survive, while the hospital-grade facilities requirements, which the justices themselves temporarily blocked, would not. Justice Anthony Kennedy could be the key player in any such scenarios, which would require at least one conservative to join the four liberals. Kennedy is a conservative who in past rulings has endorsed Roe v. Wade, but has voted to uphold some abortion restrictions. “It comes down to Justice Kennedy, and during the argument he didn’t show his hand too much,” said John Seago, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life’s legislative director, adding that the ruling could give abortion opponents “ideas about what laws we could pass.” Another possibility is that the court returns the case to a lower court for further proceedings, as Kennedy suggested during March 2 oral arguments. “It’s overwhelming for me when I think what could happen if it’s not a favorable decision,” said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at two Texas Whole Woman’s Health clinics. “I try not to think about it every minute of every day.” ",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered a message of ethnic harmony on Friday at a Christian evangelical conference as he sought to calm concern about his criticism of a Mexican-American judge. In a departure from his usual freewheeling style, Trump read a carefully scripted speech from a teleprompter as part of a new push by his campaign to tone down the outspoken New Yorker’s harsh rhetoric. Trump’s remarks included a wide-ranging attack on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and he said money aimed at resettling Syrian refugees in the United States should instead be spent on tackling poverty in U.S. cities. Speaking to the annual conference of the conservative Faith & Freedom Coalition, Trump did not mention the controversy over his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel cannot treat him fairly because of his Mexican heritage. But Trump did make a point of saying he would represent all Americans if elected president on Nov. 8. “Freedom of any kind means no one should be judged by their race or their color and the tone of his hue,” Trump said. “Right now, we have a very divided nation. We’re going to bring our nation together.” Paul Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, had criticized Trump for what he called a “textbook definition of a racist comment” for his remarks about the judge. Other Republican leaders warned Trump to change his tone or risk losing their support. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who  led a movement to derail Trump’s nomination, told CNN he would not consider running for the White House. Romney blasted Trump for comments that he said denigrated Mexicans, women and religion. “Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry and trickle-down misogyny - all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America,” he said. Romney said he expects Trump to get the Republican nomination, but said that he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. He left open the possibility of casting a ballot for the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. As Trump sought to rally more Republicans behind him, Clinton met with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to try and shore up support from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Clinton later addressed the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the nonpartisan arm of the women’s health group, and had Trump trained in her sights. “This is a man who has called women pigs, dogs and disgusting animals, it’s kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights,” said Clinton, the first woman to become the presumptive presidential nominee of a major party.   Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points, nearly the same  as a week ago, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.       Trump on Friday criticized Clinton’s willingness to accept thousands of Syrian refugees into the United States and challenged her to “replace her support for increased refugee admission” in favor of a new jobs program for inner cities.     He stopped short of repeating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, a proposal that has drawn heavy fire from Republicans and Democrats. “We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what’s going on with refugees where we don’t know where they’re coming from,” Trump said. “We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans so they can come out of this horrible situation that they’re in.” At the funeral on Friday of boxing champion Muhammad Ali, a convert to Islam, one speaker, a rabbi, inveighed against politicians promoting intolerance of Muslims.  “We will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down Muslims and blaming Muslims for a few people,” said Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine, who said he attended the ceremony in Louisville, Kentucky, as a representative of American Jews. Trump said Clinton’s refusal to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” - favored by Republicans to describe violent Islamist militants - makes her unfit to be president. The real estate mogul’s struggle to unify Republicans behind his insurgent candidacy was apparent at the evangelical Faith & Freedom conference, where several speakers studiously avoided speaking his name. Former campaign rival Carly Fiorina steered clear of Trump, speaking instead of the need to prevent liberal policies taking hold.  U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, said a Republican president is needed, without mentioning Trump. “We don’t want this contest this fall to just be a contest of personalities,” she said. But conference organizer Ralph Reed was adamant in his support for Trump, saying the New Yorker has energized the evangelical vote in a way that past Republican presidential nominees failed to do. “We understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied,” Reed told the crowd.

        "src_passage": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump fired Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager who helped him win Republican presidential nominating contests but clashed with other advisers on how to appeal to the broader general electorate, several people with knowledge of the decision said on Monday. The firing on Monday morning was another shakeup for a campaign already at odds with many senior Republican figures over the presumptive nominee’s policies, with the party’s nominating convention in Cleveland less than a month away.  But it may also prove a step toward calming concerns among party leaders about Trump, a wealthy businessman and political outsider, and the conflicting advice he was getting from senior aides, as he battles presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trump said Lewandowski did “a great job” but “it’s time now for a different kind of a campaign.” “We ran a small, beautiful, well-unified campaign. It worked very well in the primaries. I think I’m probably going to do some of that,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News, in which he did not say if Lewandowski had been fired. Three people close to the campaign said some of Trump’s staff viewed Lewandowski as opposing strategic changes and staff hires urged for the general election campaign by Paul Manafort, a strategist hired in April partly for his experience on presidential campaigns that Lewandowski lacked. The three, a campaign staffer and two people in regular contact with Trump advisers, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by Trump to discuss the firing. Manafort will take over as campaign manager, said Carl Paladino, co-chairman of the campaign’s operations in New York state. “Paul’s in charge,” Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee’s communications director, said in an interview. Trump’s decision to fire his manager came in part at the urging of his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who have powerful advisory roles in the campaign, the two people in contact with Trump aides said.  Hope Hicks, who single-handedly fields Trump’s media inquiries, disputed reports she had complained about Lewandowski to Ivanka Trump. “That is entirely untrue,” she said. Lewandowski, 42, had been a near-constant presence at Trump’s side since the New York developer launched his campaign on June 2015.  In a brief statement read on CNN, Lewandowski said: “I stand by the fact that Mr. Trump is a great candidate and is better than Hillary Clinton ever will be.”  Lewandowski denied there were any tensions between him and Trump’s family in an interview with CNN. Later on Monday, a campaign adviser resigned after reveling in Lewandowski’s exit on his Twitter account, CNN reported. “Ding dong the witch is dead!” Michael Caputo, the adviser, wrote shortly after reports of the firing emerged. He later released a statement to CNN saying he had resigned. “In hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move,” his statement said. The RNC spokesman did not think there would be a change in Trump’s tone. “It’s going to be more of a streamlined effort and more of an understanding of the difference that a general election has,” Spicer said. Clinton’s campaign has hundreds more staff than that of Trump. In contrast to her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid, there has been no public sign this time of any significant infighting among her advisers. The former U.S. secretary of state has also spent millions of dollars on television commercials in recent weeks. Trump has not aired any paid advertisements since becoming the presumptive nominee, preferring to spread his message through his Twitter account and in media interviews. Trump has faced setbacks in the past two weeks. His renewed calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States have drawn heavy criticism from Republican politicians in Washington and prompted corporate sponsors like Apple and JPMorgan Chase to withhold funding from the party’s July 18-21 convention. Recent opinion polls show at least half of all voters approve of the Muslim ban. Lewandowski, a former New Hampshire field director for a conservative advocacy group, argued that Trump’s unconventional campaigning style did not need to be changed after it proved successful in the last few months of primary contests. Lewandowski repeatedly defended that strategy with a line that became his mantra: “Let Trump be Trump.”  Known for his brusque manner, Lewandowski was accused of manhandling a female reporter in Florida during the primary campaign, but the battery charge against him was later dropped. He is still scheduled to attend the Cleveland convention as chairman of New Hampshire’s delegation. The Democratic National Committee said Lewandowski’s exit was unlikely to change Trump. “It wasn’t Corey Lewandowski who called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States,” Mark Paustenbach, a party spokesman, said in a statement, “it was Donald Trump.” ",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Front-runner Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will have essentially sealed the Republican U.S. presidential nomination if he wins Tuesday’s contest in Indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival Ted Cruz. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist opinion poll showed Trump with a wide lead in Indiana, 49 percent to 34 percent for Cruz and 13 percent for a third candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, sounded confident in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” when asked whether Indiana would basically end the long-running Republican race in his favor. “Yes, it’s over,” Trump said. “It’s already over.” The poll showed the depth of the challenge facing Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas who is trying to prevent Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates needed to seal the nomination.  Cruz’s hopes rest on emerging as a consensus alternative to Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 18-21. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 68, leads U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, 74, of Vermont in the race for the Democratic nomination. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Cruz, 45, was asked several times whether he would support Trump if the New York businessman was the Republican nominee. Cruz evaded the question each time and turned the questions into an attack on broadcast media. “I recognize that many in the media would love to see me surrender to Donald Trump because that means that Hillary wins. The media has given $2 billion in free advertising to Donald Trump,” Cruz said. Cruz said he has momentum in Indiana based on his choice of former candidate Carly Fiorina for his vice president and Friday’s endorsement by Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Americans will elect a successor to President Barack Obama on Nov. 8. Trump, who has amassed 996 delegates, according to an Associated Press count, has momentum behind him and looks increasingly likely to win the nomination outright, without a contested convention, perhaps when California votes on June 7. Indiana has 57 Republican delegates. Three are awarded from each of the state’s nine U.S. congressional districts with the candidate who receives the most votes taking them all. The 30 others are awarded to the candidate who wins the most votes statewide. At a rally in Terre Haute, Indiana, Trump urged Republicans to join his “movement” and turn out for him in big numbers. “The more we can win by in Indiana is so important. It’s a mandate ... a really important mandate. It’s a mandate for change, but not Obama change. Real change. It’s a mandate for genius,” he said. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a leading Republican critic of Trump, called him the “most unelectable person” the party could nominate. Graham had sought the nomination himself. “Keep fighting Ted,” Graham told CBS’s “Face the Nation.” On the Democratic side, front-runner Clinton told CNN’s “State of the Union” that rival Bernie Sanders has been “helpful” in bringing millions of people into the party’s presidential race, but it was time for him to step aside. “There comes a time when you have to look at the reality,” said Clinton, who won four of the five Northeastern states that voted last Tuesday and who has a big lead in the delegate race ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 25-28. But at a news conference in Washington, Sanders refused to get out, saying he believes the Democratic battle will end up in a contested convention. Sanders said it was nearly impossible for Clinton to win the 2,383 delegates needed for nomination without superdelegates, who are unelected and free to support any candidate they wish. “We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining,” he said. Clinton has 2,165 to Sanders’ 1,357 delegates, according to an AP count that includes superdelegates who have said whom they support. In his Fox interview, Trump defended at length his views on foreign policy, which he outlined in a speech last week in Washington that drew criticism for sometimes contradictory views. Trump said he would move quickly to destroy Islamic State’s militancy, but would resist interventionist policies in order to focus on nation-building at home. Trump said “every move we made in the Middle East was wrong” over the past 15 years, with lives and money wasted. He said he would resist such policies. Asked whether the United States should return to working with “strongmen” leaders like the late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Trump said: “Isn’t it too bad that we knocked him out in the first place?” ",

        "src_passage": "= The Boat Race 1920 =\n\nThe 72nd Boat Race took place on 27 March 1920 . Generally held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . As a result of the First World War , this was the first race for six years : Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the previous race held in 1914 . Both universities had participated in various Peace Regattas in 1919 . In this year 's race , umpired by former rower Frederick I. Pitman , Cambridge won by four lengths in a time of 21 minutes 11 seconds . The victory took the overall record to 39 â 32 in Oxford 's favour .\n\n= = Background = =\n\nThe Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the \" Dark Blues \" ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the \" Light Blues \" ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1914 race by four and a half lengths , and led overall with 39 victories to Cambridge 's 31 ( excluding the \" dead heat \" of 1877 ) .\nThe First World War caused a six @-@ year hiatus in the event : during the conflict , at least 42 Oxbridge Blues were killed , including four of the previous race 's Cambridge crew and one from the Oxford boat . No race was arranged for 1919 , but the crews participated in the Peace Regatta at the Henley Royal Regatta that year . Taking part in the King 's Cup , Cambridge were defeated by the Australian Army crew in the semi @-@ final , the latter going on to defeat Oxford in the final . The Light Blues also took part in the Inter Allied Peace Regatta in Paris the same year , victorious in the final against New Zealand and Australia crews .\nOxford were coached by R. W. Arbuthnot ( who had rowed for Cambridge four times between 1909 and 1912 ) , Harcourt Gilbey Gold ( Dark Blue president for the 1900 race and four @-@ time Blue ) and E. D. Horsfall ( who had rowed in the three races prior to the war ) . Cambridge 's coaches were Steve Fairbairn ( who had rowed in the 1882 , 1883 , 1886 and 1887 races ) and Sidney Swann ( who had rowed in the previous four races ) . For the twelfth year the umpire was Old Etonian Frederick I. Pitman who rowed for Cambridge in the 1884 , 1885 and 1886 races . He was accompanied on his launch by Prince Albert and Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester .\n\n= = Crews = =\n\nThe Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 9 lb ( 80 @.@ 1 kg ) , 1 @.@ 25 pounds ( 0 @.@ 6 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . As a result of the six @-@ year hiatus , none of the participants had rowed in the Boat Race prior to this year . Three of the participants in the race were registered as non @-@ British : Oxford 's Hugh Cairns and Neil Harcourt MacNeil , and Cambridge 's John Alan Campbell were all Australian .\n\n= = Race = =\n\nCambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . The race started at 5 : 40 p.m. with a fair tide in front of \" immense crowds \" ; The Times reported that the attendance was the largest in the race 's history despite a rainstorm an hour before the race start . Both crews rowed 38 strokes and were level for the first minute until Cambridge , slightly reducing their rating began to pull ahead , holding a canvas @-@ length lead by the Mile Post .\nAs the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge , the Light Blues held a three @-@ quarter length lead and with the bend in the river in their favour , pulled further ahead to be a quarter of a length clear by The Doves pub . Facing a strong headwind , Oxford pulled in behind Cambridge and attempted a \" bold bid for the inside of the Barnes corner \" . Cambridge spurted in response and passed below Barnes Bridge three lengths ahead , and extended their lead to four lengths by the time they passed the finishing post in a time of 22 minutes 11 seconds . According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater , Cambridge \" rowed and in nice easy fashion \" while Oxford \" were very uneven at times and the crew seemed to labour badly in the rough water . \" It was Cambridge 's second consecutive victory , albeit over a six @-@ year span , and took the overall record in the event to 39 â 32 in Oxford 's favour .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "VILLAVICENCIO, Colombia (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged Colombians skeptical of a peace deal with guerrillas to be open to reconciliation with those who have repented, speaking hours after a top rebel leader asked the pontiff for forgiveness.  Dear people of Colombia: do not be afraid of asking for forgiveness and offering it,  he said, at an emotional meeting that brought together victims of the 50-year civil war with former guerrilla and paramilitary fighters. The Argentine pope, leader of the world s Roman Catholics, is visiting Colombia with a message of national reconciliation, as the country tries to heal the wounds left by the conflict and bitter disagreements over a peace deal agreed last year. Francis flew to the city of Villavicencio in Meta province, a vast cattle ranching area which was a hotbed of right-wing paramilitary and Marxist guerrilla violence during a conflict with successive governments. As he arrived, former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel leader Rodrigo Londono, now the head of a new political party, issued an open letter to the pope asking for forgiveness for the suffering the group inflicted. [nL2N1LP0UZ]  Your repeated expressions about God s infinite mercy move me to plead your forgiveness for any tears or pain that we have caused the people of Colombia,  Londono, who goes by the alias Timochenko, said in the letter. Tens of thousands of ecstatic people in this humid area of savanna and shantytowns packed the roads as the pope, riding in the front seat of a simple car, passed by on Friday morning after his plane arrived from the capital Bogota. The pope s afternoon prayer meeting in Villavicencio with about 6,000 survivors of the brutal conflict was the centerpiece of his five-day trip to overwhelmingly Catholic Colombia. He listened to personal accounts from four people, including a woman who joined a paramilitary group when she was 16, a former FARC guerrilla, and two victims of violence between the guerrillas and paramilitary squads. One of the victims, Pastora Mira Garc a, told how she lost her father, husband and two children in the conflict. To great applause she urged forgiveness to  break the cycle of violence  and said she could now  name the unnamable and forgive the unforgivable . On the wall of the stage was a destroyed statue of Jesus Christ recovered from a church attacked by the FARC in 2002 in the rain forest village of Bojaya. About 80 people were killed as they sought refuge from rebel bombings inside the humble church. The plaster figure, without arms or legs, has become an enduring symbol of the war.  As we look at it, we remember not only what happened on that day, but also the immense suffering, the many deaths and broken lives, and all the blood spilled in Colombia these past decades,  the pope said. Conflict between right-wing paramilitary squads, Marxist rebels, and government forces since the 1960s has killed more than 220,000 people and left millions more displaced. Now Colombians are deeply polarized as they prepare to receive 7,000 former fighters, such as Londono, into society. Many are furious that under last year s peace deal, FARC leaders accused of kidnapping and murder will avoid jail sentences and may receive seats in congress as members of a new political party. [nL1N1DN22O] Francis addressed this hesitancy head-on.   Undoubtedly, it is a challenge for each of us to trust that those who inflicted suffering on communities and on a whole country can take a step forward,  he said.   Let us heal that pain and welcome every person who has committed offences, who admits their failures, is repentant and truly wants to make reparation.  As he left Villavicencio, he stopped to pray at the Reconciliation Cross, a memorial to survivors and those killed during the war, and planted a tree as a symbol of peace. Earlier, Francis celebrated a Mass for hundreds of thousands of people on a muddy field to beatify Pedro Maria Ramirez, a priest who was killed in 1948 during a period of political violence known as  La Violencia,  and Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo, killed in 1989 by the National Liberation Army (ELN) for suspected collaboration with the military.

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Israel  faced repeated heckling at a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday before he apologized for his stinging criticism of liberal American Jews and promised to be less inflammatory in an official capacity. David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer Trump has called a longtime friend and trusted adviser, has supported Jewish settlement building and advocated the annexation of the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war. His nomination has been fiercely opposed by some American Jewish groups. Friedman repeatedly expressed regret for likening liberal American Jews to Jewish prisoners who worked for the Nazis during the Holocaust, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his opening statement, “I regret the use of such language.” Trump is following through on a promised shift in U.S. policy toward Israel after years of friction between former President Barack Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Flanked by Netanyahu at a White House news conference, Trump on Wednesday dropped a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of its Middle East policy, even as he urged Netanyahu to curb settlement construction. The heated opposition to Friedman’s nomination erupted in the hearing room as Friedman began his opening statement, with several hecklers including a man who held up the Palestinian flag and shouted about Palestinian claims to the land of Israel. “My grandfather was exiled,” the man said before being escorted out of the room. “Palestinians will always be in Palestine!” Democratic senators pressed Friedman on incendiary comments he made including calling Obama an anti-Semite and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, an appeaser. “Frankly the language you have regularly used against those who disagree with your views has me concerned about your preparedness to enter the world of diplomacy,” Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the committee, told the nominee. Friedman acknowledged using overheated rhetoric as part of his passionate support for the Jewish state, which has included financial support of Jewish settlements built on land claimed by Palestinians. He promised to avoid inflammatory comments as a U.S. diplomat. He told Cardin, “There is no excuse. If you want me to rationalize it or justify it, I cannot. These were hurtful words and I deeply regret them.” Cardin, citing Friedman’s criticism of Schumer as having done the “worst appeasement of terrorists since Munich,” retorted that those words were “beyond hurtful.”  “We need a steady hand in the Middle East, not a bomb thrower,” admonished Tom Udall, another Democrat. Under questioning, Friedman tried to soften his positions on a number of hot-button regional issues.  While expressing skepticism of a two-state solution calling for the creation of Palestinian state next to Israel, he acknowledged it was the best option for peace. He said he did not personally support Israeli annexation of the West Bank and agreed with Trump’s view that settlement activity “may not be helpful” to achieving peace. “You’re here today having to recant every single strongly held belief that you’ve expressed, almost,” the committee’s Republican chairman, Bob Corker, noted. Friedman is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged that Friedman has said things he did not agree with but backed the nominee as qualified, experienced and passionate. “I believe he is the right guy at the right time. He’ll be Trump’s voice. Trump won the election,” Graham said.  Five former U.S. ambassadors to Israel from both Republican and Democratic administrations urged the Senate in a letter to reject Friedman, saying that he holds “extreme, radical positions” on issues such as Jewish settlements and the two-state solution. “We believe him to be unqualified for the position,” wrote the former ambassadors including Thomas Pickering, Edward Walker, Daniel Kurtzer, James Cunningham and William Harrop. While campaigning for the presidency, Trump pledged to switch the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv, where it has been located for 68 years, to Jerusalem, all but enshrining the city as Israel’s capital regardless of international objections.

        "src_passage": "ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday it would keep the Houthi-controlled Hodeidah port, vital for aid, open for a month despite a fresh missile attack against Riyadh, but it kept up air raids that killed at least nine people. The Western-backed coalition, which controls Yemen s airspace and port access, said last month it would allow humanitarian relief through Hodeidah following a nearly three-week blockade imposed because of a missile attack toward the Saudi capital s international airport. The Saudis say the Red Sea port, which is Yemen s main entry point for food and humanitarian supplies, is also a hub used by the Houthis to bring in weapons, which it accuses Iran of supplying. Tehran denies the charges. On Wednesday, the coalition confirmed it would keep access open to the port despite another missile attack at Riyadh on Tuesday by the Houthis which Saudi forces also intercepted.   Keen to maintain humanitarian aid to the brotherly Yemeni people and as a result of intensified inspection measures, the coalition command announces that Hodeidah port will remain open for humanitarian and relief supplies,  the coalition said in a statement carried by Saudi state news agency SPA on Wednesday. The Saudi ambassador to Sanaa said the coalition would also allow the provision of four cranes to the port to boost aid deliveries to the war-damaged country. The ambassador, Mohammed al-Jaber, who was speaking in a televised news conference, did not give details on how the cranes would be delivered.  Earlier this year, the United Nations said the coalition turned back four cranes the United States donated to the World Food Programme to boost aid operations at Hodeidah.  The cranes would have replaced parts of the port s infrastructure destroyed by coalition air strikes in August 2015, damage that forced ships to line up offshore because they could not be unloaded. The coalition said ships bringing in fuel and food would also be allowed to enter for another 30 days while proposals made by the United Nations envoy to Yemen were implemented, it added. The agency did not elaborate on the proposals. But the coalition has been demanding that a U.N. inspection regime agreed in 2015 be further tightened to prevent weapons from reaching the Houthis. SALMAN-TRUMP CALL Saudi state news agency SPA said King Salman discussed in a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump ways  to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its hostile acts and its involvement in supplying the Houthi militia with missiles to threaten the security of the kingdom and the region . The White House later confirmed the call and said the two leaders  agreed on the importance of reinvigorating a political process to end the war in Yemen  and that the king briefed Trump on a Saudi plan  to alleviate the humanitarian crisis  caused by the conflict. Tuesday s missile attack took place as the Houthis marked 1,000 days since the coalition intervened in the Yemen war in March 2015 to try to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after a Houthi advance on his base in Aden forced him to flee. Saudi Arabia said that since the war began the Houthis had fired 83 ballistic missiles toward the kingdom. More than 10,000 people have been killed and a humanitarian crisis unleashed in a conflict which has intensified since former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed on Dec. 4. Coalition forces, which are supported by the United States and Britain, meanwhile launched fresh air strikes overnight.  Residents said at least nine members of the same family, including at least five children, were killed in one air strike which hit their home in Wadi Khair in southern Yemen s Shabwa province. Coalition aircraft have been providing air support for southern fighters and pro-government troops as part of a push to clear the Houthis from Shabwa and the family were killed in an apparently mistaken attack. Residents also reported that coalition aircraft bombed a new parliament chamber, part of a government compound being built in Sanaa, causing damage but no casualties. The coalition had no immediate comment on the report but says it does not target civilians. Similar air strikes in which civilian homes, markets and hospitals were hit are recurrent in Yemen. On Monday, eight women and two children from the same family died when war planes struck a vehicle returning from a wedding party in Marib, east of Sanaa. ",

        "src_passage": "= Central dense overcast =\n\nThe central dense overcast , or CDO , of a tropical cyclone or strong subtropical cyclone is the large central area of thunderstorms surrounding its circulation center , caused by the formation of its eye wall . It can be round , angular , oval , or irregular in shape . This feature shows up in tropical cyclones of tropical storm or hurricane strength . How far the center is embedded within the CDO , and the temperature difference between the cloud tops within the CDO and the cyclone 's eye , can help determine a tropical cyclone 's intensity . Locating the center within the CDO can be a problem for strong tropical storms and with systems of minimal hurricane strength as its location can be obscured by the CDO 's high cloud canopy . This center location problem can be resolved through the use of microwave satellite imagery .\nAfter a cyclone reaches hurricane intensity , an eye appears at the center of the CDO , defining its center of low pressure and its cyclonic wind field . Tropical cyclones with changing intensity have more lightning within their CDO than steady state storms . Tracking cloud features within the CDO , using frequently updated satellite imagery , can also be used to determine its intensity . The highest maximum sustained winds within a tropical cyclone , as well as its heaviest rainfall , are usually located under the coldest cloud tops in the CDO .\n\n= = Characteristics = =\n\nIt is a large region of thunderstorms surrounding the center of stronger tropical and subtropical cyclones which shows up brightly ( with cold cloud tops ) on satellite imagery . The CDO forms due to the development of an eyewall within a tropical cyclone . Its shape can be round , oval , angular , or irregular . Its development can be preceded by a narrow , dense , C @-@ shaped convective band . Early in its development , the CDO is often angular or oval in shape , which rounds out , increases in size , and appears more smooth as a tropical cyclone intensifies . Rounder CDO shapes occur in environments with low levels of vertical wind shear .\nThe strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection within the CDO , which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops . The radius of maximum wind is usually collocated with the coldest cloud tops within the CDO , which is also the area where a tropical cyclone 's rainfall reaches its maximum intensity . For mature tropical cyclones that are steady state , the CDO contains nearly no lightning activity , though lightning is more common within weaker tropical cyclones and for systems fluctuating in intensity .\n\n= = Eye = =\n\nThe eye is a region of mostly calm weather at the center of the CDO of strong tropical cyclones . The eye of a storm is a roughly circular area , typically 30 â 65 km ( 20 â 40 miles ) in diameter . It is surrounded by the eyewall , a ring of towering thunderstorms surrounding its center of circulation . The cyclone 's lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye , and can be as much as 15 % lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the storm . In weaker tropical cyclones , the eye is less well @-@ defined , and can be covered by high cloudiness caused by cirrus cloud outflow from the surrounding central dense overcast .\n\n= = Use as a tropical cyclone strength indicator = =\n\nWithin the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The central dense overcast ( CDO ) pattern is one of those patterns . The central dense overcast utilizes the size of the CDO . The CDO pattern intensities start at T2.5 , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity , 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) . The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered . The farther the center is tucked into the CDO , the stronger it is deemed . Banding features can be utilized to objectively determine the tropical cyclone 's center , using a ten degree logarithmic spiral . Using the 85 â 92 GHz channels of polar @-@ orbiting microwave satellite imagery can definitively locate the center within the CDO .\nTropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) and 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) can have their center of circulations obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge . Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the CDO using rapid scan geostationary satellite imagery , whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @-@ hour .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "= Frog battery =\n\nA frog battery is an electrochemical battery consisting of a number of dead frogs ( or sometimes live ones ) , which form the cells of the battery connected in a series arrangement . It is a kind of biobattery . It was used in early scientific investigations of electricity and academic demonstrations .\nThe principle behind the battery is the injury potential created in a muscle when it is damaged , although this was not fully understood in the 18th and 19th centuries ; the potential being caused incidentally due to the dissection of the frog 's muscles .\nThe frog battery is an example of a class of biobatteries which can be made from any number of animals . The general term for an example of this class is the muscular pile .\nThe first well known frog battery was created by Carlo Matteucci in 1845 , but there had been others before him . Matteucci also created batteries out of other animals , and Giovanni Aldini created a battery from ox heads .\n\n= = Background = =\n\nIn the early days of electrical research , a common method of detecting electric current was by means of a frog 's leg galvanoscope . A good supply of live frogs was kept to hand by the researcher ready to have their legs prepared for the galvanoscope . Frogs were therefore a convenient material to use in other experiments . They were small , easily handled , the legs were especially sensitive to electric current , and they carried on responding longer than other animal candidates for this role .\n\n= = Preparation = =\n\nIt was usual to use the thighs of frogs for the battery construction . The legs of the frog were first skinned , then the lower leg was cut off at the knee joint and discarded . Damaging the muscle during this procedure would detract from the results . The thigh muscle was then cut in two transversely to produce two half @-@ thighs . Only the lower , conical shaped piece was kept . The half @-@ thighs were then laid on an insulator of varnished wood so arranged that the inside surface of one was in contact with the outside surface of the next , with the conical ends of the outside surface being pushed into the cavity of the cut surface . The ends of the pile were placed in cups of water sunk into the wood and formed the terminals of the battery .\nThe arrangement of inside surface connected to outside surface was on the basis of the incorrect theory that there was an electric current in muscles continually flowing from the inside to the outside . It is now known that the half @-@ thighs were more successful at generating electricity because they had suffered the greatest injury to the muscle . This effect of increased electric potential due to injury is known as demarcation potential or injury potential .\nOther constructions could also be used . For instance the complete rear legs could be used with the sciatic nerves exposed so that the nerve of one frog could be connected to the feet of the next . Whole frogs too could be used . Although it was more time consuming to prepare the thigh muscles , most experimenters preferred to do this since it gave better results .\n\n= = History = =\n\nThe first frog battery was constructed by Eusebio Valli in the 1790s with a chain of 10 frogs . Valli had difficulty understanding all of his own results ; he followed Luigi Galvani in believing that animal electricity ( or galvanic electricity ) was a different phenomenon from metal @-@ metal electricity ( or voltaic electricity ) , even denying its existence . Alessandro Volta 's theory was proved correct when he succeeded in constructing the voltaic pile without the use of any animal material . Because Valli found himself on the wrong side in this dispute , and refused to change his opinion despite the evidence , his work has become a bit of a backwater and his frog battery is little known and poorly documented .\nLeopoldo Nobili built a frog battery in 1818 out of complete frog legs which he called a frog pile . He used this to investigate animal electricity but his experiments were strongly criticised by Volta who argued that the true source of electricity was dissimilar metals in the external circuit . According to Volta , fluids in the frog merely provided the electrolyte .\nThe first well @-@ known frog battery was constructed by Carlo Matteucci which was described in a paper presented to the Royal Society in 1845 by Michael Faraday on his behalf . It later also appeared in the popular medical student physics textbook Elements of Natural Philosophy by Golding Bird . Matteucci constructed his battery from a pile of 12 to 14 half @-@ thighs of frogs . Despite the misguided theory behind the half @-@ thigh battery , Matteucci 's frog battery was nevertheless sufficiently powerful to decompose potassium iodide . Matteucci aimed with this apparatus to address Volta 's criticism of Nobili by constructing a circuit , as far as possible , entirely out of biological material and hence prove the existence of animal electricity . Matteucci also studied the effects vacuum , various gases , and poisons had on the frog battery , concluding that in many cases its operation was not affected even when the substance would be toxic or lethal to the living animal .\nFrogs were not the only creatures to be press @-@ ganged into serving as battery components . In 1803 Giovanni Aldini demonstrated that electricity could be obtained from an ox head from a freshly killed animal . A frog galvanoscope connected between the ox 's tongue and ear showed a reaction when the circuit was completed through the experimenter 's own body . A greater reaction was obtained when Aldini joined two or three heads together into a battery . Later , in the 1840s , Matteucci also created eel batteries , pigeon batteries and rabbit batteries . Further , he created a battery out of living pigeons by connecting a wound made on the breast of one pigeon to the body of the next . Matteucci states that this design was based on a pre @-@ existing battery of living frogs .\n\n",

It was held at Highbury Stadium on 12 October 1953 . The game was played between Arsenal , champions of the 1952 â 53 Football League and Blackpool , who had beaten Bolton Wanderers to win the 1953 FA Cup Final . This was Blackpool 's first FA Charity Shield appearance to Arsenal 's ninth .\nIn the match , Blackpool started strongly and scored first with Stan Mortensen 's goal in the 30th minute . Against the run of play , however , Arsenal equalised through Tommy Lawton and in the second half they went ahead when Doug Lishman reacted first to a rebounded shot . Lishman scored his second of the match in the 80th minute , which sealed a seventh Charity Shield honour for Arsenal .\n\n= = Background = =\n\nThe FA Charity Shield was founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield . It was a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League , and then by 1913 teams of amateur and professional players . In 1921 , it was played by the Football League champions and FA Cup winners for the first time .\nArsenal qualified for the 1953 FA Charity Shield as champions of the 1952 â 53 Football League First Division . The other Charity Shield place went to Blackpool who won the 1952 â 53 FA Cup . The final of the competition , which pitted Blackpool against Bolton Wanderers , was best remembered for Stanley Matthews ' performance , and later associated by his name . The 1953 Shield marked Blackpool 's first appearance in the annual contest . By contrast , this was Arsenal 's ninth Charity Shield appearance ; prior to the game they had won six Shields ( 1930 , 1931 , 1933 , 1934 , 1938 and 1948 ) , and lost two ( 1935 and 1936 ) .\nArsenal announced their team two days before the match , recalling Cliff Holton who had recovered from injury . Blackpool refused to reveal their team until the evening of 12 October , but manager Joe Smith did confirm to the press that Matthews would start .\n\n= = Match = =\n\n\n= = = Summary = = =\n\nOn a foggy , floodlit night at Highbury , it was the visitors who dominated the early proceedings ; The Times football correspondent assessing that Blackpool 's forward line had \" â¦ flowed sweetly , the ball on the ground in the most lovely [ sic ] , sweeping movements . \" Matthews was at the heart of their best moves and , in particular , one pass through the Arsenal defence sent Bill Perry clear on goal . He tripped over the incoming Arsenal goalkeeper Jack Kelsey , but quickly managed to get up . With Kelsey out of his line , Perry was presented with the chance to score , but his shot hit the post . Blackpool continued to create chances and went ahead after 30 minutes of play . Breaking forward with the ball from the half @-@ way line , Matthews combined with his team @-@ mate Ernie Taylor , which culminated in Stan Mortensen getting the better of his marker and shooting past Kelsey .\nDespite Blackpool 's dominance , Arsenal managed to equalise seconds before half @-@ time . From the left wing , Holton got the better of his opponent Eddie Shimwell by taking the ball off him , and proceeded to cross ; the ball found Tommy Lawton who scored from the byline . Once play resumed in the second half , Blackpool struggled to reproduce the same kind of intensity that had merited their earlier lead . Arsenal dictated play the longer the match went on , and looked more assured in defence â The Times singled out Mercer â s growing influence , adding \" â¦ one noticed the improvement of [ Bill ] Dodgin at centre @-@ half , and the high promise of young [ Len ] Wills , playing only his second game at right back . \"\nArsenal took the lead in the 65th minute when Jimmy Logie 's pass was collected by Holton . His shot at goal rebounded into the path of Doug Lishman , who was following up , and he scored . Ten minutes before the end , a cross by Don Roper into Blackpool â s penalty area was headed down by Lawton ; the ball reached Lishman who scored again to make sure of Arsenal 's win .\nThe Shield was presented to Arsenal by Lord Alexander of Tunis , the Minister of Defence . Gate receipts for the match totalled Â£ 6 @,@ 589 . In his assessment of the game , The Manchester Guardian 's football correspondent John Woodcock wrote : \" The football was not the only thing that had been of a high order . The sportsmanship and spirit in which it was played had been in every way as fine . \" Arsenal ended the season 12th in the First Division , and reached the fourth round of the FA Cup .

        "src_passage": " (This Oct. 9 story has been refiled to add a dropped word in the headline) By Sonya Dowsett BILBAO, Spain (Reuters) - As Spain and Catalonia head toward a constitutional collision over the region s claim to independence, lawmakers on both sides of the crisis are pointing to a way out: north, to Basque Country. Among the verdant mountains of Basque Country, which borders France, a once-violent campaign for independence has petered out, with generous fiscal autonomy from Madrid helping to keep popular agitation for independence in check.  We don t have that economic resentment,  Aitor Esteban, organizer for the Basque National Party in Spain s parliament, told Reuters in an interview at party headquarters in Bilbao.  People don t feel that need to act upon a grievance about money; that makes a big difference.  The Catalan government is not calling for a Basque-style deal, insisting instead on independence after declaring overwhelming support for secession in an Oct. 1 referendum banned by Madrid. But the most moderate lawmakers in the region s ruling coalition privately say they could drop independence claims if they were given the tax autonomy that Basque Country enjoys. In Madrid, some socialists have suggested it could serve as a model for a compromise that would defuse Spain s biggest political crisis since a failed coup in 1981, although the cost to the central government would be significant. Basque staged modest protests over Madrid s violent crackdown on Catalonia s referendum, but the crisis has failed to rekindle secessionist fervor on the streets of Bilbao, the Basque capital nestled on the banks of the Nervion. Catalan flags hang from balconies alongside the Basque flag in a sign of solidarity, but Bilbao is prosperous and peaceful. Where once unionist politicians needed bodyguards and car bombings were a constant fear, tourists now crowd the taverns of the old town and the world-famous Guggenheim museum. Just 17 percent of Basques want independence and less than half would like to hold a referendum on the issue, according to a poll carried out by the university of Deusto. Basque militant group ETA, which killed more than 850 people in a decades-long campaign to carve out a separate state, effectively ended its armed resistance this year when it surrendered its weapons. The region now has one of the highest economic outputs per capita and one of the lowest unemployment rates in Spain.  The independence debate is on standby in Basque Country because of great fatigue after years of violence and uncertainty after the economic crisis,  said Xabier Barandiaran, professor of sociology at Deusto University. Basque s fiscal autonomy is among the most generous of any region in Europe, dating back to the 19th century and enshrined in Spain s 1978 constitution. If it were to be extended to Catalonia, an economically more powerful region accounting for a fifth of national production, the Spanish state would lose about 16 billion euros, according to a 2014 study by research house CSIC. That would equal about 13 percent of next year s budget and affect Spain s deficit and borrowing costs. For that reason, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has ruled out such generous treatment for Catalonia. Under Basque s accord with Madrid, the region collects nearly all its own taxes, which are forecast to total 13 billion euros ($15 billion) this year. It is due to return 800 million euros to Madrid in what is known as an annual quota to cover the costs of national expenses such as defense or infrastructure. Rajoy has sweetened that arrangement since he regained power at the head of a minority government last year, as the price of securing Basque National Party support for his 2017 budget. It has proved unpopular with other regions who would almost certainly oppose any similar deal for Catalonia, as it would mean cutting their share of state revenue. Typically, regions pass taxes to Madrid which redistributes money back to them according to a formula that favors the poorer regions. Former Catalan leader Artur Mas tried to hold talks with Rajoy in 2012 about granting Catalonia powers to raise and spend its own taxes, but the prospect of negotiations in the current climate look bleak. Catalonia has long said it pays a disproportionate level of taxes to Madrid in relation to the central funding it receives. A study backed by the Budget Ministry says Catalonia pays to the state 9.9 billion euros more than it receives. The Catalan economy ministry says this is even higher. Economists say an overhaul of the fiscal relationship between Madrid and the regions is overdue because the current system has led to intense tax competition between regions. Some autonomous communities have become under-financed, resulting in cuts in public services.  Now the situation is so critical, there might just be the political momentum needed to tackle it,  said Antonio Garcia Pascual of Barclays Capital. ",

        "src_passage": "= Pine Middle School shooting =\n\nThe Pine Middle School shooting was a school shooting that occurred in Reno , Nevada , United States , on March 14 , 2006 . The shooting was perpetrated by then fourteen @-@ year @-@ old student James Scott Newman who shot and injured two 14 @-@ year @-@ old eighth grade classmates with a .38 @-@ caliber revolver that had belonged to his parents . Newman was arrested and charged as an adult on charges of attempted murder , use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor but later plead guilty to different charges of two counts of battery with a deadly weapon , in which he had received sentencing as a juvenile . James Newman was sentenced to house arrest until he completed 200 hours of community service .\nOn March 25 , 2008 , athletics teacher Jencie Fagan , who was hailed a hero for her confrontation with the shooter , was selected as one of the three national winners for the Above & Beyond Citizen Honor from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society at a ceremony in Washington , D.C.\n\n= = The shooting = =\n\nOn the day of the shooting , the start of school had been delayed by snow and not all students had arrived when the shooting began . Just before 9 : 00 a.m. ( UTC @-@ 8 ) , fourteen @-@ year @-@ old student James Scott Newman brought his mother 's .38 @-@ caliber revolver to the school in his backpack . He removed the concealed pistol from his coat pocket and loaded it with three .38 caliber rounds while in the bathroom . He chose his target , student Alexander Rueda , 14 , at random in a hallway outside the cafeteria . Before he started firing , a friend of Newman yelled at him to put the gun away , but Newman told him to run . He pulled the trigger twice but the gun did not fire because those chambers were empty . He then fired three times at Rueda . One bullet hit Rueda in the arm and torso , and another ricocheted and hit student Kenzie McKeon , 14 , in the leg from the shrapnel . The two injured students had no prior relationship or arguments with Newman . Several students and teachers heard the shots and the physical education teacher , Jencie Fagan , approached Newman and challenged him . Fagan managed to convince Newman to drop his gun and then restrained him until more staff arrived to help .\nAlexander Rueda was treated at Washoe Medical Center for his wounds and released the same day , while Kenzie McKeon only needed to be treated at the scene for superficial wounds . The school was placed on lockdown for an hour and then classes were canceled for the remainder of the day . The shooting was the second firearm @-@ related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks , with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus . On this occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution .\n\n= = = Motive = = =\n\nAfter the shooting , Newman was interviewed by the police and remained determined that he did not want his parents to be present during questioning , however Newman 's father had arrived sometime after to ask for the questioning to stop until a lawyer would be consulted . During questioning Newman stated that he wanted to use the attack as a way to end abuse from his father , brother , and others . He said he was tired of being called \" stupid \" by them . He researched the Columbine High School massacre on the Internet and planned the attack about a week in advance . He conclusively decided against using a knife because \" he did not want to be up close when blood came out of any of the victims . \" The night before the attack , Newman 's father had given him a collection of ammunition which included three live .38 caliber rounds . When his parents left the house to eat , he took his mother 's handgun from a small safe in his father 's closet and hid it in his backpack .\n\n= = Aftermath = =\n\nFollowing the shooting , police arrested James Newman and booked him as an adult on charges of suspicion of attempted murder , use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor in Washoe County Jail with a bail of $ 150 @,@ 000 . However , his trial was put on hold as prosecutors discussed whether he should be tried as an adult or juvenile . Washoe District Attorney Richard Gammick had announced on March 17 that the evidence given did not support Newman being charged as an adult . By May 2006 , Newman was tried as a juvenile by the Jan Evans Juvenile Justice Center for the charges of two counts of battery with a deadly weapon , instead of the initial charges and was put under house arrest until he completed 200 hours of community service .\nOn March 25 , 2008 , Jencie Fagan was selected as one of three national winners and the Nevada finalist for an Above & Beyond Citizen Honor from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society in the Washington , D.C. ceremony , being recognized for her role in prevention of any further incident in the shooting .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raw feelings and mistrust could pose an obstacle to President Donald Trump and hard-line conservative lawmakers in his Republican Party as they seek to rebound from defeat on healthcare legislation by launching into an overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Trump has accused the Freedom Caucus lawmakers of snatching a “defeat from the jaws of victory” with their rejection of the White House-backed healthcare bill to replace President Barack Obama’s 2010 healthcare reform bill. In interviews with 10 of the roughly three dozen House Freedom Caucus members, the lawmakers said they were eager to put aside tensions over the healthcare debacle and seek common ground on tax reform. But there is no consensus, even within the conservative faction, on details of a tax-reform bill, with some members open to discussing ideas such as the border tax plan supported by House leaders and others opposed to it. Representative Warren Davidson, a Freedom Caucus member from Ohio, said Republicans should leave aside the blame game and work through their policy differences before launching tax reform legislation. “Some people are still in that hurt-feelings and frustration” stage, Davidson said. “I do think it’s smart to take the time to get it right.” Republican Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, a Freedom Caucus lawmaker who sits on the tax-writing House of Representative Ways and Means Committee, could emerge as a bridge between the conservative faction and House leaders. The panel will work closely with House leadership on the tax bill. Schweikert said he planned to consult with rank-and-file members to discuss plans and listen to their priorities. He said giving companies incentives to invest in plants and equipment was one of the items on his own wish list. “My personal fixation is very simple: What maximizes economic growth?” Schweikert said. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said the group has “no formal position” on the structure of tax reform legislation. But Meadows listed the top priorities on his own wish list: “Lower taxes, lower taxes and lower taxes.” A 35-page blueprint developed by House Republican leaders, known as a “Better Way,” will serve as a starting point for the tax-reform discussions. The plan calls for streamlining the income tax system and cutting the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It would exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports.  The border tax proposal has divided the business community and is a top flashpoint for lawmakers. Big exporters such as General Electric Co say the tax would boost manufacturing and jobs. But retailers like Target Corp have said the border tax would hike consumer prices and hurt the economy. Trump, a businessman who had never been in public office until he took over at the White House on Jan. 20, has at times praised the border tax idea but at other times has been noncommittal. Virginia Congressman Dave Brat said he would insist that the tax bill not add to the deficit, while Meadows said he would not necessarily insist on that. Other conservatives said they needed more information about the tax bill to form an opinion - and some space from the contentious health care debate. “We just had a major battle on a Republican welfare plan and that has consumed to a large degree my time and mental effort,” said Alabama Representative Mo Brooks. “When we have a tax reform bill I can evaluate, that’s when I’ll start voting on it,” Brooks said. As a sign of tensions that have lingered after the collapse of the healthcare bill, Freedom Caucus lawmakers faced tough questioning from their colleagues during a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, said Representative Randy Weber of Texas. But Weber said some of the friction eased by the end of the meeting, prompting House Speaker Paul Ryan to say that more give and take might have been useful in the healthcare effort. “Ryan said: ‘This is what we should have been doing,’” Weber told Reuters. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he thinks lawmakers learned lessons from the healthcare defeat that could apply to tax reform. “I think people are going to work harder to get to ‘yes’ this next piece of legislation,” Buck said. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday showed Republicans mostly blame Congress, and not Trump or party leaders, for failing to pass the healthcare overhaul.                        ",
