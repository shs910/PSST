{"src_passage":"So, I kind of believe that we're in like the \"cave-painting\" era of computer interfaces. \nLike, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. \nHit me. \nOK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right? \nIt's very flat, kind of rigid. \nAnd OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac, you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years. \n  Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. \nI mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing. \nAnd so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. \nIt's so much more subtle, so much more visceral -- you know, what's visible, what's not. \nAnd I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop. \nSo I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop. \nIt's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. \nSo you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. \nAnd instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull, things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk, I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. \nAnd once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. \nWhen they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? \nAnd then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. \nAlso, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that? \nI just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. \nAlso some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought -- I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further? \nAnd one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. \nBut what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right? \n So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right? \nThis is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. \nDespite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared, because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties. \nAnd some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. \nSo one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later. \nOr if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner. \nAlso just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices. \nAnd I can pull them off when I want to work with them. \nSo, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, \"Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.\" \nSo one thing we have for that is like a grid align, kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. \nMore boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. \nAnd you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. \nLet's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. \nI think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software -- I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs. \nI think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. \nI can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. \nAnd I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. \nSo I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know -- okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here, and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. \nAnd that's BumpTop. Thanks! \n","predictions":"So, I kind of believe that we're in like the \"cave-painting\" era of computer interfaces. \nLike, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. \nHit me. \nOK.

Just like on my real desk, I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. \nAnd once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. \nWhen they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? \nAnd then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. \nAlso, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that? \nI just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. \nAlso some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought -- I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further? \nAnd one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. \nBut what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right? \n So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right? \nThis is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. \nDespite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared, because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties. \nAnd some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. \nSo one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later. \nOr if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner. \nAlso just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices. \nAnd I can pull them off when I want to work with them. \nSo, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, \"Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.\" \nSo one thing we have for that is like a grid align, kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. \nMore boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. \nAnd you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. \nLet's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. \nI think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software -- I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs. \nI think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. \nI can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. \nAnd I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. \nSo I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know -- okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here, and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. \nAnd that's BumpTop. Thanks! \n","num_tokens":1256,"num_sentence":53}

And you know, even I could tell my hip was bad, and I actually work in marketing. \nSo he said, \"Allison, we've got to get you on the table. \nI'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait.\" \n18 more months. \nI'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months. \nYou know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs. \nI wouldn't have my new hip for this TED. \nI wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa. \nI would not have my new hip for TED2008. \nI would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing. \nSo, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital, and that's when I had my epiphany. \nThis youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line. \nOh yeah. \nCan I tell you how un-Canadian that is? \nWe do not think that way. \nWe don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration. \nIn fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians. \n\"After you.\" \"Oh, no, no. After you.\" \nHey, are you from Canada? \"Oh, me too! Hi!\" \n\"Great! Excellent!\" \nSo no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list. \nSome 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening. \nNo, no. Front of the line. \nSo by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign. \nAnd I saw a sign. \nIn the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, \"Volunteers Needed.\" Hmm. \nWell, they signed me up immediately. \nNo reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no. \nThey were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75. \nYeah.

We start with the posture. \nThis is the posture of ladies who are not blogging; this is the posture of ladies who are blogging. \n This is the natural posture of a man sitting, squatting for ventilation purposes. \n And this is the natural posture of a standing man, and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me into the lateral thinking session. \nThis is male blogging posture sitting, and the result is, \"For greater comfort, men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women, when working on laptop. \nHowever, they will adopt a less natural posture in order to balance it on their laps, which resulted in a significant rise of body heat between their thighs.\" This is the issue of local warming. \n This is a very serious newspaper; it's Times of England -- very serious. This is a very --  -- gentlemen and ladies, be serious. \nThis is a very serious research, that you should read the underline. \nAnd be careful, your genes are in danger. \nWill geeks become endangered species? \nThe fact: population growth in countries with high laptop --  I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph. \n Global warming fun. \n But let's keep things in proportion. \nHow to take care in five easy steps: first of all, you can use natural ventilation.

We start with the posture. \nThis is the posture of ladies who are not blogging; this is the posture of ladies who are blogging. \n This is the natural posture of a man sitting, squatting for ventilation purposes. \n And this is the natural posture of a standing man, and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me into the lateral thinking session. \nThis is male blogging posture sitting, and the result is, \"For greater comfort, men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women, when working on laptop. \nHowever, they will adopt a less natural posture in order to balance it on their laps, which resulted in a significant rise of body heat between their thighs.\" This is the issue of local warming. \n This is a very serious newspaper; it's Times of England -- very serious. This is a very --  -- gentlemen and ladies, be serious. \nThis is a very serious research, that you should read the underline. \nAnd be careful, your genes are in danger. \nWill geeks become endangered species? \nThe fact: population growth in countries with high laptop --  I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph. \n Global warming fun. \n But let's keep things in proportion. \nHow to take care in five easy steps: first of all, you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath. \nYou should stay cool with the appropriate clothing. \nYou should care about your posture -- this is not right. \nCan you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me, because I have a video I have to show you. \n You are great.

{"src_passage":"Good morning. \nLet's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci. \nWe're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings. \nBut we do not know his face. \nThousands of books have been written about him, but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks. \nEven this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians. \nSo, what do you think? \nIs this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it? \nLet's find out. \nLeonardo was a man that drew everything around him. \nHe drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything. \nBut no faces? \nI find that hard to believe. \nHis contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters. \nSo, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time. \nSo let's try to find them. \nI think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us. \nSo I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits. \nThere are about 120, you see them here. \nWhich ones of these could be self-portraits? \nWell, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters. \nSo we can eliminate all the profiles. \nIt also has to be sufficiently detailed. \nSo we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized. \nAnd we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man. \nSo we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures. \n And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill. \nAnd here they are. \nYes, indeed, the old man is there, as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus. \nAnd lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, \"The Musician.\" \nBefore we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them. \nI've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only. \n But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces. \nSo I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces. \nOK, now let's look at these three portraits. \nAnd hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin. \nI couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that. \nThere is no reason why these portraits should look alike. \nAll we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar. \nNow, are they made in the right order? \nThe young man should be made first. \nAnd as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case. \nThey are made in the right order. \nWhat was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit? \nYes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made. \nSo we have three pictures, potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time. \nBut how do we know it's him, and not someone else? \nWell, we need a reference. \nAnd here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted. \nIt's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David, for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15. \nAnd if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again. \nThe statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces. \nLadies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published. \nIt's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first. \nThe icon of icons finally has a face. \nHere he is: Leonardo da Vinci. \n","predictions":"Good morning. \nLet's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci. \nWe're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings. \nBut we do not know his face. \nThousands of books have been written about him, but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks. \nEven this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians. \nSo, what do you think? \nIs this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it? \nLet's find out. \nLeonardo was a man that drew everything around him. \nHe drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything. \nBut no faces? \nI find that hard to believe. \nHis contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters. \nSo, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time. \nSo let's try to find them. \nI think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us. \nSo I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits. \nThere are about 120, you see them here. \nWhich ones of these could be self-portraits? \nWell, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters. \nSo we can eliminate all the profiles. \nIt also has to be sufficiently detailed. \nSo we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized. \nAnd we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man. \nSo we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures. \n And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill. \nAnd here they are. \nYes, indeed, the old man is there, as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus. \nAnd lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, \"The Musician.\" \nBefore we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them. \nI've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only. \n But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces. \nSo I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces. \nOK, now let's look at these three portraits. \nAnd hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin. \nI couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that. \nThere is no reason why these portraits should look alike. \nAll we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar. \nNow, are they made in the right order? \nThe young man should be made first. \nAnd as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case. \nThey are made in the right order. \nWhat was the age of Leonardo at the time?

{"src_passage":"So, as researchers, something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities, or achieve certain goals. \nAnd this is essential to the progress of science, or exploration of what is possible. \nBut it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology. \nSomething that motivates me, and gets me really excited about my research, is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population. \nI'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention that I think embody this philosophy. \nAnd they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote. \nFor those of you who aren't familiar with this device, it's a $40 video game controller. \nAnd it's mostly advertised for its motion-sensing capabilities: so you can swing a tennis racket, or hit a baseball bat. \nBut what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera. \nAnd I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful. \nSo here, I have my computer set up with the projector, and I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it. \nAnd, for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money, probably a lot of schools, or if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard, normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. \nSo I'm going to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote. \nNow, this requires another piece of hardware, which is this infrared pen. \nYou can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the Radio Shack. \nIt's got a battery, a button and an infrared LED -- you guys can't see it -- but it turns on whenever I push the button. \nNow, what this means is that if I run this piece of software, the camera sees the infrared dot, and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels. \nAnd now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface. \n So for about $50 of hardware, you can have your own whiteboard. \nThis is Adobe Photoshop. \n Thank you. \n The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. \nIn the three months this project has been public, it's been downloaded over half a million times. \nSo teachers and students all around the world are already using this. \n Although it does do it for 50 dollars, there are some limitations of this approach. \nYou get about 80 percent of the way there, for one percent of the cost. \nAnother nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots, so this is actually a multi-touch, interactive whiteboard system as well. \n I have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV. \nSo it's pointing away from the display, rather than pointing at the display. \nAnd why this is interesting is that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses, that have two infrared dots in them, they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location. \nAnd why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor, which has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it. \nAnd you can see that it looks like a 3D room. \nkind of like a video game, it sort of looks 3D, but for the most part, the image looks pretty flat, and bound to the surface of the screen. \nBut if we turn on head tracking -- the computer can change the image that's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements. \nSo let's switch back to that. \n  So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game-development community. \n Because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii. \nSo I'm looking forward to seeing some games, and actually Louis Castle, that's him down there, last week announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers, is releasing a game in May that has a little Easter egg feature for supporting this type of head tracking. \nAnd that's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product. \n Thank you. \nBut actually, to me, what's almost more interesting than either of these two projects is how people actually found out about them. \nYouTube has really changed the way, or changed the speed, in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world. \nI'm doing some research in my lab with a video camera, and within the first week, a million people had seen this work, and literally within days, engineers, teachers and students from around the world were already posting their own YouTube videos of them using my system or derivatives of this work. \nSo I hope to see more of that in the future, and hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community. \nSo thank you very

That I take something bad, I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this, all these pieces. \nThat's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved. \nI was a big record collector -- the records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you, film burns. Film burns. \nI mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film. \nThe negatives are gone. \nThat's my father's letter to me, telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was 20. \nThat's my daughter and me. \nShe's still there. She's there this morning, actually. \nThat's my house. \nMy family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley. \nThat's my wife, Heidi, who didn't take it as well as I did. \nMy children, Davey and Henry. \nMy son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago. \nSo, my message to you folks, from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED. \nI came to live it, and I am living it. \nThat's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon, just 35 miles from here. \nThank you everybody. \n","num_tokens":1059,"num_sentence":78}

{"src_passage":"It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say, \"What is your most precious natural resource?\" -- they will not say children at first. \nAnd then when you say children, they will pretty quickly agree with you. \n: We're traveling today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia, head of the army and the head of the police, and we're dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television, no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years. \nThe importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC, the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement. \nThere are one billion children in the world, and 50 percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school. \nAnd in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school. \nAnd I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go. \nSo in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype, it's gone from an idea to a real laptop. \nWe have half a million laptops today in the hands of children. \nWe have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children, and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment. \nSo, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops. \nThat's smaller than I predicted -- I predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number. \nIn Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops. \nIt's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working, not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off, in which the people who had been causing, if you will, 40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived. \nAnd suddenly, the kids have connected laptops. \nThey've leapfrogged. \nThe change is absolutely monumental, because it's not just opening it up, but it's opening it up to the rest of the world. \nSo yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone, yes, there will be television. \nBut the kids six to 12 years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages, so the children grow up with access to information, with a window into the rest of the world. \nBefore, they were closed off. \nInterestingly enough, in other countries, it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth. \nAnd that engine is going to see the results in 20 years. \nIt's not going to happen, you know, in one year, but it's an important, deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children. \nThirty-one countries in total are involved, and in the case of Uruguay, half the children already have them, and by the middle of 2009, every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop. \nNow what are some of the results? \nSome of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much, and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets. \nProbably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents. \nThey own the laptops. They take them home. \nAnd so when I met with three children from the schools, who had traveled all day to come to Bogota, one of the three children brought her mother. \nAnd the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write. \nHer mother had not gone to primary school. \nAnd this is such an inversion, and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change. \nSo now, in closing, people say, now why laptops? \nLaptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No. \nThe reason you want laptops is that the word is education, not laptop. \nThis is an education project, not a laptop project. \nThey need to learn learning.

We went to Haiti, we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mongolia. \nPlaces that are not markets, seeding it with the principles of saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc. \nAnd then we can actually roll out large numbers. \nSo think of it this way: think of it as inoculating children against ignorance. \nAnd think of the laptop as a vaccine. \nYou don't vaccinate a few children. \nYou vaccinate all the children in an area. \n","predictions":"It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say, \"What is your most precious natural resource?\" -- they will not say children at first. \nAnd then when you say children, they will pretty quickly agree with you. \n: We're traveling today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia, head of the army and the head of the police, and we're dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television, no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years. \nThe importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC, the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement. \nThere are one billion children in the world, and 50 percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school. \nAnd in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school. \nAnd I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go. \nSo in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype, it's gone from an idea to a real laptop. \nWe have half a million laptops today in the hands of children. \nWe have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children, and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment. \nSo, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops. \nThat's smaller than I predicted -- I predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number. \nIn Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops. \nIt's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working, not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off, in which the people who had been causing, if you will, 40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived. \nAnd suddenly, the kids have connected laptops. \nThey've leapfrogged. \nThe change is absolutely monumental, because it's not just opening it up, but it's opening it up to the rest of the world. \nSo yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone, yes, there will be television. \nBut the kids six to 12 years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages, so the children grow up with access to information, with a window into the rest of the world. \nBefore, they were closed off. \nInterestingly enough, in other countries, it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth. \nAnd that engine is going to see the results in 20 years. \nIt's not going to happen, you know, in one year, but it's an important, deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children. \nThirty-one countries in total are involved, and in the case of Uruguay, half the children already have them, and by the middle of 2009, every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop. \nNow what are some of the results? \nSome of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much, and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets. \nProbably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents. \nThey own the laptops.

{"src_passage":"I was asked by Wilsonart International, a plastic laminate company, which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, in 2000. \nSo looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look. \nWhen this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer. \nSo I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion. \nI decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream. \nWhat I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. \nIn that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. \nIn fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin. \nThat seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. \nWe really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. \nWe stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. \nWe took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. \nI literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in. \nThe main goal was to smooth out the interior, and begin to speak about motion, and mobility, and independence. \nThe biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. \nThere's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together, where you can change materials and shapes. \nSo that became a challenge. \nCompounding that, the material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight, only bends in two dimensions. \nIt's a compound curve interior. \nWhat I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. \nWhat I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. \nAnd what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. \nThey also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin, so they function as an electrical chase. \nThat's the trailer, pretty much finished. \nThat trailer led to another commission, to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block. \nIts a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October. \nTeruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. \nHe said one he would like to make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one. \nTrailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want. \nWe came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States, that would collect records and go on tours. \nThis trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system. \nIt's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people, and basically we'd had a great time with this. \nAnd so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel, and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense. \nA lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream. \nThis brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream. \nThey came to me and said, \"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up? \nAnd do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?\" \nAnd I said, \"Well, not in that interior.\" \n Anyway, I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype, and it's called the Bambi prototype. \nI thought, \"Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding.\" \nAnd I walked in their prototype facility, and it's exactly like my shop, only bigger -- same tools, same things. \nSo the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding. \nThe trailers themselves are actually hand-built. \nAll the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely, so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers, you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit. \nThey didn't want to go to a componentized system. \nAnd there it is, that's the Bambi 16. \n","predictions":"I was asked by Wilsonart International, a

exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. \nIn that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. \nIn fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin. \nThat seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. \nWe really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. \nWe stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. \nWe took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. \nI literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in. \nThe main goal was to smooth out the interior, and begin to speak about motion, and mobility, and independence. \nThe biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. \nThere's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together, where you can change materials and shapes. \nSo that became a challenge. \nCompounding that, the material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight, only bends in two dimensions. \nIt's a compound curve interior. \nWhat I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell. \nWhat I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. \nAnd what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. \nThey also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin, so they function as an electrical chase. \nThat's the trailer, pretty much finished. \nThat trailer led to another commission, to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block. \nIts a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October. \nTeruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. \nHe said one he would like to make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one. \nTrailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want. \nWe came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States, that would collect records and go on tours. \nThis trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system. \nIt's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people, and basically we'd had a great time with this. \nAnd so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel, and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense. \nA lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream. \nThis brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream. \nThey came to me and said, \"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up? \nAnd do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?\" \nAnd I said, \"Well, not in that interior.\" \n Anyway, I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype, and it's called the Bambi prototype. \nI thought, \"Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding.\" \nAnd I walked in their prototype facility, and it's exactly like my shop, only bigger -- same tools, same things. \nSo the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding. \nThe trailers themselves are actually hand-built. \nAll the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely, so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers, you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit. \nThey didn't want to go to a componentized system. \nAnd there it is, that's the Bambi 16. \n","num_tokens":1354,"num_sentence":46}
{"src_passage":"It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing. \nMost of them are pretty basic. \nNumber one: don't let go -- very sure success method. \nBut really, truly -- often you think about letting go way before your body does. \nSo hang in there, and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions. \nNumber two: hesitation is bad. \nThis is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows, in the Yosemite high country. \nFriction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges. \nYou're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock. \nThe most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock. \nAnd then from that point on, you're basically falling. \nSo momentum is good. Don't stop. \nRule number three: have a plan. \nThis is a climb called the Naked Edge, in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder. \nThis climber is on the last pitch of it. \nHe's actually right about where I fell. \nThere is about 1,000 feet of air below him. \nAnd all the hard pitches are actually below him. \nOften what happens is you're planning so hard for like, \"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?\" \nAnd then what happens? \nYou get to the last pitch. It's easy. \nAnd you're completely flamed out. Don't do it. \nYou have to plan ahead to get to the top. \nBut you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete. \nThis is a climb called the Dike Route, on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country. \nThe interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard. \nBut if you're the leader on it, at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall, onto some low angle slabs. \nSo you've got to focus. \nYou don't want to stop in the middle like Coleridge's Kubla Kahn. \nYou've got to keep going. \nRule number five: know how to rest. \nIt's amazing. The best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest, regroup, calm themselves, focus, and keep going. \nThis is a climb in the Needles, again in California. \nFear really sucks because what it means is you're not focusing on what you're doing. \nYou're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you're doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively. \nOne of the things in climbing is, most people sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution. \nThis is the Devils Tower in Wyoming, which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from \"Close Encounters.\" \nWith this, typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing. \nThe cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips in the cracks, and using opposing pressure and forcing yourself up. \nRule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success. \nIn the 35 years I've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that, the most important thing I've learned was, guys will always try to do pull-ups. \nBeginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash, they get 15 feet up -- and they can do about 15 pull-ups right -- And then they just flame out. \nWomen are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups. \nThey think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long. \nSo balance is really critical, and keeping your weight on your feet, which is your strongest muscle. \nAnd of course there is rule number nine. \nI came up with rule number nine after I actually didn't plan for a fall, and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib. \nOnce you get to that point where you know it's going to happen, you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt -- how you're going to fall onto the rope, or if you're climbing without a rope, fall to a place where you can actually control the fall. \nSo don't hang on till the bitter end. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"It's pretty simple.

\nWell to explain that, I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during 1975 and 1979. \nVideo: April 17th, 1975. \nThe communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam, and American bombing campaigns. \nLed by peasant-born Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia, much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China. \nThe Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world. \nBut after four years the grim truth seeps out. \nIn a country of only seven million people, one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders, their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields. \nSophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration, on April 17th 1975 we lived in Phnom Penh. \nAnd my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days. \nAnd here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge. \nThey were young soldiers, typically child soldiers. \nAnd this is very normal now, of modern day conflict, because they're easy to bring into wars. \nThe reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off. \nI mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan, including the two nuclear bombs of August 1945. \nThe Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money. \nSo the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank But not just that, they actually banned money. \nI think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used. \nAnd we know money is the root of all evil, but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact. \nMy family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province. \nThis is a picture of what Pursat looks like. \nIt's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia, where rice growing takes place. \nAnd in fact they were forced to work the fields. \nSo my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp, labor camp. \nAnd it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam. \nAnd she spoke some Vietnamese, as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends. \nAnd she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors, that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive, because at this point they're forcing everybody to work. \nAnd they're giving about -- in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess -- they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice. \nAnd at about this time actually my father got very sick. \nAnd he didn't speak Vietnamese. \nSo he died actually, in January 1976. \nAnd it made it possible, in fact, for us to take on this plan. \nSo the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev, which is across from the border from Vietnam. \nAnd there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested. \nAnd my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible, she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names. \nBut she'd given the boys girls' names, and the girls boys' names. \nAnd it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively, that she was able to go into her exam and -- you know, this was a moment of truth. \nIf she fails, we're all headed to the gallows; if she passes, we can leave to Vietnam. \nAnd she actually, of course -- I'm here, she passes. \nAnd we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side. \nAnd then onwards to Chau Doc. \nAnd this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today. \nA pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta. \nBut for us it meant freedom. \nAnd freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge. \nLast year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on, started, and I decided that as a matter of record with the Tribunal about my father's passing away. \nAnd I got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. \nAnd it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future, because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times. \nFive years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc. \nAnd she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom, but also fear, because we had just come out of Cambodia. \nI'm happy, actually, today, to present her. \nShe's here today with us in the audience. \nThank you mother. \n","predictions":"I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war. \nBut today I've got a personal story to share with you. \nThis is a picture of my family, my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977. \nAnd we're actually Cambodians. \nAnd this picture is taken in Vietnam. \nSo how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?

{"src_passage":"So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation. \nNow, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year, I didn't bring a human brain, but I did bring a liter of bone marrow. \nAnd bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients, most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases. \nSo, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford. \nI'm in the operating room. We have Bob here, who is a volunteer donor. \nWe're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia. \nSo actually how do we harvest this bone marrow? \nWell we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses, and another doctor across from me. \nBob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle, you know, not too big. \nAnd the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue, and kind of punch it into the hard bone, into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out, each time, with a syringe. \nAnd hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin. \nHands it back to me. And we do that again and again. \nAbout 200 times usually. \nAnd by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand, let alone Bob, whose rear end looks something more like this, like Swiss cheese. \nSo I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years. \nAnd there is probably a better way to do this. \nSo I thought of a minimally invasive approach, and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner. \nThis is it. \nAnd the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here. \nOur standard see-through patient. \nInstead of entering the bone dozens of times, we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. \nAnd we have a flexible, powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around. \nSo it enables you to very rapidly aspirate, or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole. \nWe can do multiple passes through that same entry. \nNo robots required. \nAnd, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia, and do this harvest as an outpatient. \nSo I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford. \nAnd played around with this a little bit. \nAnd our team members developed this technology. \nAnd eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies. \nAnd we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out, but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device. \nThis device was just FDA approved in the last year. \nHere is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around. \nThere will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole. \nThis was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient. \nAnd we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient. \nSo why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells. \nYou all know about embryonic stem cells. \nThey've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials. \nAdult stem cells are throughout our body, including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow, which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years. \nIn the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease, vascular disease, orthopedics, tissue engineering, even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes. \nWe've just come out, we're commercializing, this year, generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner. \nThe hope is that this gets more stem cells out, which translates to better outcomes. \nIt may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live-saving bone marrow donors. \nIt may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier, to use in the future should you need it. \nAnd ultimately -- and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors, who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford. \nHopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future. \nThanks. \n","predictions":"So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation. \nNow, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year, I didn't bring a human brain, but I did bring a liter of bone marrow. \nAnd bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients, most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases. \nSo, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford. \nI'm in the operating room.

{"src_passage":"I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved. \nI'd like to start with a little experiment. \nCould you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery? \nNow, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly. \nBut it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. \nThe World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people. \nThey also have an estimate of around a billion. \nBut in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population. \nAnd the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. \nGlasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful. \nThe problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world. \nThere are just way too few eye care professionals. \nSo this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K. \nThis is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa. \nIn fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. \nHow do you do this? How do you solve this problem? \nI came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this. \nAnd the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. \nWhat I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses. \nI shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket. \nI'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them. \nSo -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there. \nI've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription. \nNext step in my process. \nSo, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription. \nOkay, so I've made these glasses and ... \nOkay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... \n... I've just ... \nAnd I've now made some glasses. That's it. \n Now, these aren't the only pair in the world. \nIn fact, this technology's been evolving. \nI started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly. \nThere are about 30,000 in use now. \nAnd they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world. \nAnd I have a vision, which I'll share with you. \nI have a global vision for vision. \nAnd that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020. \nTo do that -- this is an early example of the technology. \nThe technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down. \nThis pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars. \nBut the cost has to be brought right down. \nIt has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day. \nHow do you solve this problem? \nYou start to get into detail. \nAnd on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have. \nHow do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing? \nHow do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem? \nHow do you deal with the industry? \nAnd the answer to that is research. \nWhat we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university. \nIf you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you. \n","predictions":"I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved. \nI'd like to start with a little experiment. \nCould you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery? \nNow, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly. \nBut it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. \nThe World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people. \nThey also have an estimate of around a billion. \nBut in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population. \nAnd the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. \nGlasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful. \nThe problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world. \nThere are just way too few eye care professionals. \nSo this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K. \nThis is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa. \nIn fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. \nHow do you do this? How do you solve this problem? \nI came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this. \nAnd the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. \nWhat I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses. \nI shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket. \nI'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them. \nSo -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there. \nI've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription. \nNext step in my process. \nSo, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription. \nOkay, so I've made these glasses and ... \nOkay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... \n... I've just ... \nAnd I've now made some glasses. That's it. \n Now, these aren't the only pair in the world. \nIn fact, this technology's been evolving. \nI started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly. \nThere are about 30,000 in use now. \nAnd they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world. \nAnd I have a vision, which I'll share with you. \nI have a global vision for vision. \nAnd that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020. \nTo do that -- this is an early example of the technology. \nThe technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down. \nThis pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars. \nBut the cost has to be brought right down. \nIt has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day. \nHow do you solve this problem? \nYou start to get into detail. \nAnd on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have. \nHow do you distribute?

{"src_passage":"I'm a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations. \nOne of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature, and trying to find hidden data within nature. \nIt seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere, all around us. \nEverything gives out some kind of data, whether it's sound or smell or vibration. \nThrough my work, I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this. \nAnd so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics. \nNow, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water, as you can see there. \nSo, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance, by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook and then Ernest Chladni. \nHe created an experiment using a metal plate, covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. \nMoving on from this, the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s. \nHe actually coined the term cymatics. \nThen bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed. \nHe's kindly recreated for us the Chladni experiment. \nWhat we can see here is the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator. \nAs the frequencies increase, so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate. \nAs you can see with your own eyes. \n So, what excites me about cymatics? \nWell, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool. \nIt's like a looking glass into a hidden world. \nThrough the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics, we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. \nDevices like the cymascope, which you can see here, have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns. \nAnd the list of scientific applications is growing every day. \nFor example, in oceanography, a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit. \nAnd hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate. \nWe can also use cymatics for healing and education. \nThis is an installation developed with school children, where their hands are tracked. It allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them. \nWe can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form. \nThis image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device. \nSo it kind of flips things on its head a little bit. \nThis is Pink Floyd's \"Machine\" playing in real time through the cymascope. \nWe can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature. \nAnd we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature. \nSo, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature. \nThen on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake. \nAnd here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish. \nAnd there is thousands of these. \nSo what does this all mean? \nWell, there is still a lot to explore in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field. \nBut consider for a moment that sound does have form. \nWe've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter. \nThen sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming. \nAnd think about the immense sound of the universe forming. \nAnd if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself. \nAnd here is some eye candy for you, from a range of DIY scientists and artists from all over the globe. \nCymatics is accessible to everybody. \nI want to urge everybody here to apply your passion, your knowledge and your skills to areas like cymatics. \nI think collectively we can build a global community. \nWe can inspire each other. \nAnd we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen.

{"src_passage":"So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here. \nI'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren. \nWhen Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space. \nMy office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half. \nAnd you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines. \nSo when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own. \nThere was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard, and without any previous building experience, and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials, I built this space. \nIt had everything I needed. It was quiet. \nThere was enough space. And I had control, which was very important. \nAs I was building this space, I thought to myself, \"Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own.\" \nSo I did some research. \nAnd I found that there was an historic precedence. \nHemingway had his writing space. \nElvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland. \nIn the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave. \nSo I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now. \nHere is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from. \nOn the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage. \nBut on the inside, it's anything but. \nAnd this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace. \nIt has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important. \nI soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside. \nThis guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf. \nAnd he found the scoreboard in the trash. \nHere's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated. \nThis a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir. \nThe guy did it all himself. \nAnd there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside. \nSo, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs. \nThere were definitely hang-out spots. \nBut some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things. \nMost of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding. \nTake this place for example. \nOn the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage. \nThis is in Long Island, New York. \nThe only thing that might tip you off is the round window. \nOn the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house. \nThe man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style. \nIt has no nails or screws. \nAll the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed. \nHere is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood. \nBut you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside. \n And so there is a good reason for this. \nIt was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough. \nHe won the silver medal for Ireland and he trains in this space. He trains other people. \nAnd right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace. \nSo, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion. \nIt's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. \nIt's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s. \nMuseum quality. \nSo, as I came to the end of my journey, I found over 50 spaces. \nAnd they were unexpected and they were surprising. \nBut they were also -- I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them. \nAnd I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did. \nAnd they really loved their professions. \nAnd they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies. \nAnd so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were. \nSo if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here. \nI'm here for two reasons.

{"src_passage":"Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS, the transmission of AIDS. \nI thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it. \nSadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know, kills approximately one million people a year. \nThe reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people a year. \nThis young girl and her friend that I met in an orphanage in Delhi were HIV positive from a syringe. \nAnd what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents threw them out on the street. \nAnd hence they ended up in an orphanage. \nAnd it comes from situations like this where you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners, blindly giving an injection to someone. \nAnd the injection is so valuable, that the people basically trust the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times, to do the right thing. But in fact they're not. \nAnd you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem between people in high-virus areas. \nThis video we took undercover, which shows you, over a half an hour period, a tray of medicines of 42 vials, which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India. \nAnd over the course of half an hour, not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped. \nThey started with two and they ended with two. \nAnd you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray, which is their sort of modular station, and dropping the syringe she's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again. \nSo you can imagine the scale of this problem. \nAnd in fact in India alone, 62 percent of all injections given are unsafe. \nThese kids in Pakistan don't go to school. \nThey are lucky. They already have a job. \nAnd that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals, wash them, and in the course of this, obviously picking them up they injure themselves. \nAnd then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre. \nIn an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him, picked up a syringe and pricked his finger -- I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end -- and immediately whipped out a box of matches, lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger, giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV. \nIn China, recycling is a major issue. \nAnd they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here -- and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes, and then put back out on the street. \nSo recycling and reuse are the major issues here. \nBut there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia. \nIn all schools in Indonesia, there is usually a toy seller in the playground. \nThe toy seller, in this case, had syringes, which they usually do, next door to the diggers, which is obviously what you would expect. \nAnd they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols. \nThey squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent. \nAnd they are having great fun. \nBut they also drink from them while they're in their breaks, because it's hot. \nAnd they squirt the water into their mouths. \nAnd these are used with traces of blood visible. \nSo we need a better product. And we need better information. \nAnd I think, if I can just borrow this camera, I was going to show you my invention, which I came up with. \nSo, it's a normal-looking syringe. \nYou load it up in the normal way. This is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license. \nYou give the injection and then put it down. \nIf someone then tries to reuse it, it locks and breaks afterwards. \nIt's very, very simple. Thank you. \n And it costs the same as a normal syringe. \nAnd in comparison, a Coca-Cola is 10 times the price. \nAnd that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times. \nwhich has done huge scale amount of work in India. \nAnd we're very proud of giving information to people, so that little kids like this don't do stupid things. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS, the transmission of AIDS. \nI thought this was unacceptable.

{"src_passage":"I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. \nHeadlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. \nThey are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. \nRecently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. \nThat report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries. \nThey wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic. \nAnd all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries. \nIt's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. \nOver 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. \nAnd every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. \nFor us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study. \nAnd in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. \nAnd one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. \nThe weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene. \nBut despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. \nIt's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. \nAnd because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system. \nBecause it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. \nWe blow it up and look at the pieces. \nThis is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. \nAtmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car. \nBut still, we look at the pieces. \nWe run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. \nOur models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. \nAnd it takes weeks to perform our integrations. And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening. \nWe also fly all over the world looking for this thing. \nI recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others. \nWe found a global atmospheric watchtower there, in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene, and of course, other things while we were there. \nThis is the tower in the middle of the rainforest, from above. \nAnd this is the tower from below. \nAnd on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. \nAnd this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people. \nSo maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. \nBut we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff. \nWe have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements. \nWe hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering. \nWe have to get special flight clearance. \nAnd as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs. \nAnd the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board. \nSo, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation. \nIt's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule. \nWe do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. \nAnd when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject. \nAnd out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. \nAnd as a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others. \nAnd each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. \nIn each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience. \nAnd we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers, in order to make headlines like these. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. \nHeadlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. \nThey are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. \nRecently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. \nThat report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries. \nThey wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic. \nAnd all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries. \nIt's a big community.

She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl. \nIn the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind. \nBut it's not about fire and brimstone either. \nIts videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges. \nNow, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. \nAnd it's called \"The 99.\" \nNow, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. \nThey were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. \nAnd his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format. \n\"The 99.\" The characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others. \nSo, for example, there is the character of Noora. \nShe is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone. \nAnother character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions. \nNow, \"The 99\" is not just a comic book. \nIt's now a theme park. \nThere is an animated series in the works. \nAnd by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with \"The 99\" to beat injustice wherever they find it. \n\"The 99\" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization. \nWe're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. \nNor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. \nI like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. \nNow, while 4Shbab and \"The 99\" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this. \nThroughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. \nAfter all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: \"We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.\" \nAnd to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed.

She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl. \nIn the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind. \nBut it's not about fire and brimstone either. \nIts videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges. \nNow, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. \nAnd it's called \"The 99.\" \nNow, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. \nThey were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. \nAnd his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format. \n\"The 99.\" The characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others. \nSo, for example, there is the character of Noora. \nShe is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone. \nAnother character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions. \nNow, \"The 99\" is not just a comic book. \nIt's now a theme park. \nThere is an animated series in the works. \nAnd by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with \"The 99\" to beat injustice wherever they find it. \n\"The 99\" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization. \nWe're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. \nNor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. \nI like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. \nNow, while 4Shbab and \"The 99\" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this. \nThroughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. \nAfter all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: \"We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.\" \nAnd to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed. Thank you. \n","num_tokens":1106,"num_sentence":55}

It's always rising, falling; a half million people visit every day. \nBut this isn't about Reddit. \nIt's about discovering new things that pop up on the web. \nIn the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes, all kinds of trends get born right on our front page. \nThis isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales. \nWell, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign. \nThe whales were getting killed; they wanted to put an end to it. \nOne of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales. \nBut to personify the movement, they wanted to name it. \nSo in true web fashion, they put together a poll, where they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names. \nI believe this is the Farsi word for \"immortal.\" \nI think this means \"divine power of the ocean\" in a Polynesian language. \nAnd then there was this: \"Mister Splashy Pants.\" \n Mister Pants, or \"Splashy\" to his friends, was very popular on the Internet. \nIn fact, someone on Reddit thought, \"What a great thing, we should all vote this up.\" \nAnd Redditors responded and all agreed. \nSo the voting started. \nWe got behind it ourselves; we changed our logo for the day, from the alien to Splashy, to help the cause. \nAnd it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying, \"We love Splashy Pants!\" \nSo it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started, to 70 percent at the end of voting. \nPretty impressive, right? We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen. \nJust kidding -- Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it, because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win. \nThey said, \"No, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting.\" \nWell, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy. \n And the Reddit community -- really, the rest of the Internet, really got behind this. Facebook groups were created. \nFacebook applications were created. \nThe idea was, \"Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants.\" \nPeople were putting up signs in the real world about this whale. \n This was the final vote: 78 percent of the votes. \nTo give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three. \nThere was a clear lesson: the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants. \nWhich is obvious. It's a great name. \nEveryone wants to hear their news anchor say, \"Mister Splashy Pants.\" \n I think that's what helped drive this. \nWhat was cool were the repercussions. \nGreenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it -- Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins, an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy. \nBut even more important was that they accomplished their mission. \nThe Japanese government called off their whaling expedition. \nMission accomplished: Greenpeace was thrilled, the whales were happy -- that's a quote. \n And actually, Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers. \nA few, certainly, but we're talking about a lot of people, really interested and caught up in this meme. \nGreenpeace came back to the site and thanked Reddit for its participation. \nBut this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool. \nThis is how the Internet works.

Be honest, up-front. \nOne of the great lessons Greenpeace learned is that it's OK to lose control, OK to take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your goal. \nThat's the final message I want to share: you can do well online. \nBut no longer is the message coming from just the top down. \nIf you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money. \nIn fact, they make their living on this stuff. \nI'm going to try to save you all the time and money and go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me. \nStarted a website in 2005 with a few friends, called Reddit.com. \nIt's what you'd call a social news website; basically, the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web. \nYou find some interesting content -- say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit, and a community of your peers votes up if they like it, down if they don't. \nThat creates the front page.

{"src_passage":"Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears, these are the dancing bears. \nIn 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on. \nBecause the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this. \nThis is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community who live across India, and have been in India since the 13th century. \nWe went about getting evidence of what was going on. \nAnd this is footage from a hidden camera in a button. \nAnd we went in, pretending to be buyers. \nAnd we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka. \nAnd the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded. \nThese were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each, and they are used for bear paw soup, and also being trained, later on, to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. \nSadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear. \nThe couple are barely 18 years old. \nThey already have four children beside them. You can see them. \nAnd the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals. \nSo, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner. \nNow, when we started working deeper and digging deeper, we found that it's an illegal act. \nThese guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities. \nAnd what they were doing to the bears was really appalling. \nIt was unacceptable. \nThe mother bears are usually killed. \nThe cubs, which are taken, are separated. \nTheir teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod. \nAnd they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle. \nNow we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood, to getting something else. \nSo, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment. \nAnd we were so unsure that this would work. \nWe weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him. \nAnd we said, \"Okay, here is some seed fund. \nLet's see if you can get something else.\" And we got the bear surrendered to -- we set up a sanctuary.

The kids never went to school. \nThey only had Islamic education, very little of it. \nAnd they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education. \nSo, we sponsor 600 children education programs today. \nWe were able to ensure brighter futures for these people. \nOf course we also had to get the bears in. \nThis is what happens to the bears when they come in. \nAnd this is what we turn them into. \nWe have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers. \nSo, basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears. \nWe rescued over 550 dancing bears. \nWe've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears. \nThe big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India, into our rescue center. \n And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries. \nAnd the people can hold their heads up high. \nAnd the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they've lived all their lives. \nAnd the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again. \nAnd there will be no more removing of these bears. \nAnd the children, both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully.

{"src_passage":"Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art. \nContemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before. \nI thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time collectors here with us at TED, local collectors, to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know. \nThe first is Bharti Kher. \nThe central motif of Bharti's practice is the ready-made store-bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads, every day, in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage. \nBut originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world. \nBharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it, by exploding it into something spectacular. \nShe also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals, which she then completely covers in bindis, often with potent symbolism. \nShe says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis, and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand. \nOur next artist, Balasubramaniam, really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation, working wonders with fiberglass. \nSince Bala himself will be speaking at TED I won't spend too much time on him here today, except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible. \nis known for her digital collages, using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material. \nThese comics are a fundamental way that children, especially in the diaspora, learn their religious and mythological folk tales. \nI, for one, was steeped in these. \nChitra basically remixes and re-titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics. \nAnd she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well. \nJitish Kallat successfully practices across photography, sculpture, painting and installation. \nAs you can see, he's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art, and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work. \nHe really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay. \nHe also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin. \nHere he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot. \nThis next artist, N.S. Harsha, actually has a studio right here in Mysore. \nHe's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition. \nHe creates these fine, delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale. \nHe uses scale to more and more spectacular effect, whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore, or in his increasingly ambitious installation work, here with 192 functioning sewing machines, fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations. \nMumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women. \nShe too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas, but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh. \nIn this particular work, she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative. \nRaqib Shaw is Kolkata-born, He too is reinventing the miniature tradition. \nHe creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch, but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth. \nHe actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect. \nI'm kind of cheating with this next artist since Raqs Media Collective are really three artists working together. \nRaqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today, working across photography, video and installation. \nThey frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization, and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work. \nHere, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens, in which the city itself may have been the culprit. \nThis next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta. \nHe was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases, paintings of everyday objects, the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. \nHe celebrates these local and mundane objects globally, and on a grander and grander scale, by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations. \nAnd finally number 10, last and certainly not least, who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka, creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial, and brings, like Subodh, the local global. \nThese are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye. \nAnd she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space, and interact with the objects. \nAnd light and shadow are a very important part of her work. \nShe also explores themes of consumerism, and the environment, such as in this work, where these basket-like objects look organic and woven, and are woven, but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars that she found in a Bangalore junkyard. \n10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in. \nBut I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today. \nThank you very much for looking and listening. \n","predictions":"Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art. \nContemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before. \nI

{"src_passage":"Please close your eyes, and open your hands. \nNow imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet. \nNow open your eyes. \nWhat about a life? \nWhat you see here is a premature baby. \nHe looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature. \nThis baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm. \nSadly, 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world. \nFour million of these babies die annually. \nBut the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe, long-term health problems. \nThe reason is because in the first month of a baby's life, its only job is to grow. \nIf it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally, resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes, to heart disease, to low I.Q. \nImagine: Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm. \nThat is the primary function of an incubator. \nBut traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars. \nSo, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries. \nAs a result, parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies, or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. \nI've seen this firsthand over and over again. \nOn one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha, who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani. \nShe took her baby to the nearest village clinic, and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator. \nBut that hospital was over four hours away, and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there, so her baby died. \nInspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution, something that could work without electricity, that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use, given that the majority of births still take place in the home. \nWe needed something that was portable, something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost, compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs. \nSo, this is what we came up with. \nWhat you see here looks nothing like an incubator. \nIt looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. \nYou can open it up completely. It's waterproof. \nThere's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily. \nBut the magic is in this pouch of wax. \nThis is a phase-change material. \nIt's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius. \nYou can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time, after which you simply reheat the pouch. \nSo, you then place it into this little pocket back here, and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby. \nLooks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities. \nWe plan to launch this product in India in 2010, and the target price point will be 25 dollars, less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator. \nOver the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies. \nBut the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth. \nThis seems counterintuitive, but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced, population sizes also decrease, because parents don't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die. \nWe hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology: simple, localized, affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact. \nIn designing this we followed a few basic principles. \nWe really tried to understand the end user, in this case, people like Sevitha. \nWe tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists. \nAnd then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem. \nIn doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses. \nAnd we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace. \n","predictions":"Please close your eyes, and open your hands. \nNow imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet. \nNow open your eyes. \nWhat about a life? \nWhat you see here is a premature baby. \nHe looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature. \nThis baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm. \nSadly, 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world. \nFour million of these babies die annually. \nBut the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe, long-term health problems. \nThe reason is because in the first month of a baby's life, its only job is to grow. \nIf it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally, resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes, to heart disease, to low I.Q. \nImagine: Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm. \nThat is the primary function of an incubator. \nBut traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars. \nSo, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries. \nAs a result, parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies, or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. \nI've seen this firsthand over and over again. \nOn one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha, who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani. \nShe took her baby to the nearest village clinic, and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator. \nBut that hospital was over four hours away, and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there, so her baby died. \nInspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution, something that could work without electricity, that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use, given that the majority of births still take place in the home. \nWe needed something that was portable, something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost, compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs. \nSo, this is what we came up with. \nWhat you see here looks nothing like an incubator. \nIt looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. \nYou can open it up completely.

And they are much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs. \nThey're expensive to install, but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that. \nBut they are not applicable in all situations. \nSo, take, for example, the three-way intersection. \non the minor road entering the major. \nBut the other two are somewhat questionable. \nSo, here's one. There's another one which I studied. \nCars rarely appear on that third road. \nAnd so, the question is, what does that cost us? \nThat intersection I looked at had about 3,000 cars per day in each direction, and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of. \nThat's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day, that's $51,000 per year. \nThat's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution, wear on the car, and time. \nWhat's that time worth? \nWell, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars, that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. \nis $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year. \nAdd that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that sign in each direction. \nDiscount that back to the present, at five percent: over two million dollars for a stop sign, in each direction. \nNow, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth, you could actually buy the property, cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line, and then sell it off again. \nAnd you'd still come out ahead. \nSo, it makes one wonder, \"Why is it there?\" \nI mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction? \nBecause it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal? \nThe answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. \nBecause there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road. \nCan that be accomplished with existing signs? \nSo, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs. \nStop signs were invented in 1915, yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got. \nSo, why not use a yield sign? \nWell the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way. \nThat means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating, or taking turns, and it's always on the minor road, allowing the major one to have primacy. \nSo, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign. \nYou couldn't suddenly tell everyone, \"OK, remember what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different.\" \nThat would not work. \nSo, what the world needs now is a new type of sign. \n you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements. \nAnd it merges the stop sign and yield signs. \nIt's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns. \nAnd uncertainty results in caution. \nWhen people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down. \nSo, now that you are all \"Road Scholars\" ... \n don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly. \nBut you all are members of communities, and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows. \nAnd you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle.

{"src_passage":"So, if you're in the audience today, or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place, you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem. \nWhether you're an artist, a technologist, a lawyer or a fan, the handling of copyright directly impacts your life. \nRights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape. \nYouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners, but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies, mashups and more, we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site. \nLet's look at a specific video so you can see how it works. \nTwo years ago, recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single \"Forever.\" \nA fan saw it on TV, recorded it with her camera phone, and uploaded it to YouTube. \nBecause Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video within seconds of attempting to upload the video, the copy was detected, giving Sony the choice of what to do next. \nBut how do we know that the user's video was a copy? \nWell, it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match. \nWe compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database. \nThis heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works. \nHere we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content. \nThe system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match. \nThis means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file, plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality. \nthat a video is uploaded to YouTube. \nAnd that's over 20 hours of video every minute. \nWhen we find a match, we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down. \nAnd the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking. \nWe're not just talking about a few videos, we're talking about over 100 years of video every day, between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site. \nWhen we compare those hundred years of video, we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database. \nIt would be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day, without so much as a coffee break. \nNow, what do we do when we find a match? \nWell, most rights owners, instead of blocking, will allow the copy to be published. \nAnd then they benefit through the exposure, advertising and linked sales. \nRemember Chris Brown's video \"Forever\"? \nWell, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts, and that looked like the end of the story, but sometime last year, a young couple got married. \nThis is their wedding video. \nYou may have seen it. \n What's amazing about this is, if the processional of the wedding was this much fun, can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been? \nI mean, who are these people? \nI totally want to go to that wedding. \nSo their little wedding video went on to get over 40 million views. \nAnd instead of Sony blocking, they allowed the upload to occur. \nAnd they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes. \nAnd the song, 18 months old, went back to number four on the iTunes charts. \nSo Sony is generating revenue from both of these. \nAnd Jill and Kevin, the happy couple, they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral. \nAnd they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows, and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference. \nThe video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence. \nThe \"JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance\" became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of \"The Office,\" which just goes to show, it's truly an ecosystem of culture. \nBecause it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, but sometimes big studios borrowing back. \nBy empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity. \nAnd all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification. \nSo why has no one ever solved this problem before? \nIt's because it's a big problem, and it's complicated and messy. \nIt's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners. \nThere's musical labels. \nThere's multiple music publishers. \nAnd each of these can vary by country. \nThere's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together. \nSo we have to manage many claims to the same video. \nYouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases. \nBut the system only works through the participation of rights owners. \nIf you have content that others are uploading to YouTube, you should register in the Content ID system, about how your content is used. \nAnd think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content. \nBy simply blocking all reuse, you'll miss out on new art forms, new audiences, new distribution channels and new revenue streams. \nBut it's not just about dollars and impressions. \nJust look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology. \nAnd I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"So, if you're in the audience today, or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place, you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem. \nWhether you're an artist, a technologist, a lawyer or a fan, the handling of copyright directly impacts your life. \nRights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape. \nYouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners, but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies, mashups and more, we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site. \nLet's look at a specific video so you can see how it works. \nTwo years ago, recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single \"Forever.\" \nA fan saw it on TV, recorded it with her camera phone, and uploaded it to YouTube. \nBecause Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video within seconds of attempting to upload the video, the copy was detected, giving Sony the choice of what to do next. \nBut how do we know that the user's video was a copy?

{"src_passage":"When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school. \nAnd as a special treat, he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands. \nAnd there it was, the seat of human consciousness, the powerhouse of the human body, sitting in my hands. \nAnd that day I knew that when I grew up, I was going to become a brain doctor, scientist, something or the other. \nYears later, when I finally grew up, my dream came true. \nAnd it was while I was doing my Ph.D. \non the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. \nIt is estimated that one in six children, that's one in six children, suffer from some developmental disorder. \nThis is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments. \nWhich means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder. \nBut here's what really perplexed me. \nDespite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain, most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior. \nBut diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms, without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart. \nIt seemed so intuitive to me. \nTo diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately, it would be necessary to look at the brain directly. \nLooking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading, picture of the child's problems. \nYet, despite all the advances in medical technology, the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited. \nAnd then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it, towards diagnosing brain disorders in children. \nTheir groundbreaking technology records the EEG, or the electrical activity of the brain, in real time, allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions: vision, attention, language, audition. \nA program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain. \nAnd another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant, allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms. \nAnd so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team, and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders. \nAnd I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India. \nI'd like to tell you about one such child, whose story was also covered by ABC News. \nSeven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism. \nLike many autistic children, his mind was locked inside his body. \nThere were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time. \nAnd the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially, and he would probably never have too much language. \nWhen we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain, the results were startling. \nIt turned out that Justin was almost He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye, but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism. \nAfter Justin was given anti-seizure medication, the change in him was amazing. \nWithin a period of 60 days, his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words. \nAnd his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ. \nResearch shows that 50 percent of children, almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. \nThese are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. \nAll these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation, language problems. \nInstead, our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments. \nSo these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. \nFor too long now, children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen. \nAnd for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. \nBut we are now in a new era of neuroscience, one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively, and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. \nSo if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. \nOne more mind will be unlocked. \nAnd one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover. \nAnd all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his

{"src_passage":"So, these are the Dark Ages. \nAnd the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid, and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy. \nStarted out with my then four-year-old: \"Oh, should buy the kid some Lego. \nThat stuff's cool.\" \nWalked into the Lego store. \nBought him this. \nIt's totally appropriate for a four-year-old. \n I think the box says -- let's see here -- \"8 to 12\" on it. \nI turn to my wife and said, \"Who are we buying this for?\" \nShe's like, \"Oh, us.\" I'm like, \"Okay. All right. That's cool.\" \nPretty soon it got a little bit out of control. \nThe dining room looked like this. \nYou walk there, and it hurts. \nSo we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex. \n Torture, very funny. \nWow, you guys are great. \nAnd we put down those little floor tiles, and then I went onto eBay and bought 150 pounds of Lego --  which is insane. \nMy daughter -- the day we got it, I was tucking her in -- and I said, \"Honey, you're my treasure.\" \nAnd she said, \"No, the Lego is the treasure.\" \n And then she said, \"Dad, we're Lego rich.\" \nI was like, \"Yeah. \nI suppose we are.\" \nSo then once you do that you're like, \"Oh, crap.

{"src_passage":"Trees epitomize stasis. \nTrees are rooted in the ground in one place but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing. \nAnd I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. \nI simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. \nI waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art. \nThe piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet. \nBut I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines. \nI multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. \nAnd so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. \nYou might have a guess. \nThe answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe. \nAnd so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic. \nAnd I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons. \nPrisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars. \nAnd our prison system itself is stuck. \nThe United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women. \nThat number is rising. \nOf the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison. \nFunds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. \nI decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes. \nIn the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. \nWorking with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. \nWe give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. \nThat, I think, is movement. \nWe partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. \nThat, I think, is movement. \nWe worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands. \nThat, I think, is movement. \nAnd just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. \nThey've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. \nThey're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day. \nWhen they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, they're placed in immobile booths like this. \nFor one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. \nAlthough we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature.

{"src_passage":"I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question: how can we make digital content graspable? \nBecause you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now. \nAnd for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there -- it's virtual. \nOn the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world. \nIt's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good. \nSo the question is: how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical? \nThat's my question. \nIf you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical. \nThe question is: what's next? \nNow, I have three options that I would like to show you. \nThe first one is mass. \nAs humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. \nSo, could we use that in mobile phones? \nLet me show you the weight-shifting mobile. \nIt is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around, and you can feel where it's heavy. \nWe shift the gravitational center of it. \nFor example, we can augment digital content with physical mass. \nSo you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. \nAnother thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city. \nIt can tell you by its weight, \"Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here.\" \nAnd the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time; you have your eyes free to see the city. \nNow, mass is the first thing; the second thing, that's shape. \nWe're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands. \nSo if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that \"Harry Potter\" -- it's thick.  So let me show you the shape-changing mobile. \nAgain, it's a mobile phone-shaped box, and this one can change its shape. \nWe can play with the shape itself. \nFor example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be; but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick. \nIt's like tapered to the downside. \nIf you change the grasp, it can adjust to that. \nIt's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands. \nIt's fairly simple. \nAnother thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone, they are bigger than the phone itself. \nSo in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, \"Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content. \nYou can't see it, but it's there.\" \nAnd you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge. \nThe shape is the second thing. \nThe third thing operates on a different level. \nAs humans, we are social, we are empathic, and that's great. \nWouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive? \nThink of a hamster in the pocket. \nWell, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it. \nLet me show you the living mobile phone. \nSo, once again, mobile phone-shaped box, but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic. \n And you can tell, it's relaxed right now. \nOh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting.  How do we calm it down? \nYou give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again. \nSo, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want. \nSo, what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us. \nAnd I think making it physical is a good way to do that. \nWhat's behind that is a postulation, namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future; rather than that, technology, a bit more human. \n","predictions":"I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question: how can we make digital content graspable? \nBecause you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now. \nAnd for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there -- it's virtual. \nOn the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world. \nIt's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good. \nSo the question is: how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical? \nThat's my question. \nIf you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical. \nThe question is: what's next? \nNow, I have three options that I would like to show you. \nThe first one is mass. \nAs humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. \nSo, could we use that in mobile phones? \nLet me show you the weight-shifting mobile. \nIt is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around, and you can feel where it's heavy. \nWe shift the gravitational center of it. \nFor example, we can augment digital content with physical mass. \nSo you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. \nAnother thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city. \nIt can tell you by its weight, \"Okay, move right.

Make a left here.\" \nAnd the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time; you have your eyes free to see the city. \nNow, mass is the first thing; the second thing, that's shape. \nWe're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands. \nSo if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that \"Harry Potter\" -- it's thick.  So let me show you the shape-changing mobile. \nAgain, it's a mobile phone-shaped box, and this one can change its shape. \nWe can play with the shape itself. \nFor example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be; but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick. \nIt's like tapered to the downside. \nIf you change the grasp, it can adjust to that. \nIt's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands. \nIt's fairly simple. \nAnother thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone, they are bigger than the phone itself. \nSo in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, \"Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content. \nYou can't see it, but it's there.\" \nAnd you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge. \nThe shape is the second thing. \nThe third thing operates on a different level. \nAs humans, we are social, we are empathic, and that's great. \nWouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive? \nThink of a hamster in the pocket. \nWell, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it. \nLet me show you the living mobile phone. \nSo, once again, mobile phone-shaped box, but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic. \n And you can tell, it's relaxed right now. \nOh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting.  How do we calm it down? \nYou give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again. \nSo, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want. \nSo, what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us. \nAnd I think making it physical is a good way to do that. \nWhat's behind that is a postulation, namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future; rather than that, technology, a bit more human. \n","num_tokens":1084,"num_sentence":54}

{"src_passage":"I'm a visual artist, and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. \nI've been working with plastic bags, which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years. \nI turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations. \nUpon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. \nAnd I thought, \"Great. \nIt's ephemeral just like us.\" \nUpon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing. \nIt's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic. \nAnd what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment. \nI then, in the last few years, learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. \nAnd my initial reaction -- and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it -- is, \"Oh my God! \nWe've got to go out there and clean this thing up.\" \nSo I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine. \nAnd my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities. \nI began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. \nAnd the bigger picture is: we need to find a way to turn off the faucet. \nWe need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. \nSo in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry. \nI wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres, potentially, of plastic in five major oceans in the world. \nIt's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. \nI'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic. \nAll of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market. \nI'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator, and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies. \nSo I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue, and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition. \nWe have many initiatives that we're working on, but some of them are very basic. \nOne is: if 80 to 90 percent of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic, then why don't we call it what it is. \nIt's plastic pollution. \nRecycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling. \nYou put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again. \nWhat is the reality of that? \nIn the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled. \nAnd if you really look into it, particularly when it comes to plastic bottles, most of it is only down-cycled, or incinerated, or shipped to China. \nIt is down-cycled and turned into lesser things, while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again. \nSo this is a big issue for us. \nAnother thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,\" three R's, and that is refuse. \nWhenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics. \nAlternatives exist; some of them are very old-school. \nI myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in. \nAnd I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family. \nIt's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle, if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water, versus purchasing plastic bottled water. \nI guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. \nWe can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. \nSo whenever possible, to choose alternatives to single-use plastics.

\nThe fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us, to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all. \nWithout that mandate, they would be corrupt. \nWell unfortunately,

awry -- a ballot box goes missing here, chads are left hanging over here. \nTo make sure as few things as possible go wrong, we have all these procedures around the election. \nSo for example, you come to the polling station, and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote. \nWhen you come back out, you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes, so that no one knows how you voted. \nWell, what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that, after you drop your vote into the ballot box. \nAnd most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted, because they trust that the election system works. \nThey trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly. \nThe ballot boxes go to counting places. \nThey're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted. \nMost of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote, and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election. \nSo we have to trust a lot of people. \nWe have to trust a lot of procedures. \nAnd sometimes we even have to trust computers. \nSo imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes, all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines, and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better. \nWell in the face of all these bad headlines, researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. \nThey've zoomed out and looked at the big picture. \nAnd the big picture is this: elections should be verifiable. \nVoters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly, without breaking election secrecy, which is so very important. \nAnd that's the tough part. \nHow do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret? \nWell, the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. \nAnd the secret is the ballot form. \nAnd if you look closely at these ballot forms, you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one. \nAnd that means, if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list, I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for. \nAnd on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right. \nAnd there's some complicated cryptography going on in there, is voting with one of these forms. \nSo we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us, and then we'll use the paper for verification. \nSo this is how you vote. \nYou get one of these ballot forms at random, and then you go into the voting booth, and you mark your choices, and you tear along a perforation. \nAnd you shred the candidate list. \nAnd the bit that remains, the one with your marks -- this is your encrypted vote. \nSo you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote. \nAnd because it's encrypted, it can be submitted, stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see, including you. \nSo you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt. \nAnd after the close of the election, you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website. \nAnd remember, the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth, so if an election official wants to find out how you voted, they will not be able to. \nIf the government wants to find out how you voted, they won't be able to. \nNo hacker can break in and find out how you voted. \nNo hacker can break in and change your vote, because then it won't match your receipt. \nVotes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it. \nBut the election magic doesn't stop there. \nInstead, we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves. \nThey can check that all the votes were counted correctly. \nThey can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one. \nAnd these are elections by the people,

website. \nAnd remember, the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth, so if an election official wants to find out how you voted, they will not be able to. \nIf the government wants to find out how you voted, they won't be able to. \nNo hacker can break in and find out how you voted. \nNo hacker can break in and change your vote, because then it won't match your receipt. \nVotes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it. \nBut the election magic doesn't stop there. \nInstead, we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves. \nThey can check that all the votes were counted correctly. \nThey can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one. \nAnd these are elections by the people, for the people. \nSo the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections.

{"src_passage":"Hello. My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old. \nI came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. \nFirst of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. \nIt seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. \nLittle kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. \nI must admit, I used to be one of them. \nI also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day. \nWhat I discovered was this is not true. \nI began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family. \nI discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. \nFirst, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. \nThat is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature -- like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. \nDon't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy. \n The seeds are then planted, then grown. \nThe food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. \nAnd most folks don't even know they exist. \nDid you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? \nThese include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. \nYet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. \nAnd let me tell you, corn is in everything. \nAnd don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS. \n Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. \nThey do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. \nNext, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs. \nWhen it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too. \nThen they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets. \nSo I ask myself, how can I change? How can I change these things? \nThis is what I found out. \nI discovered that there's a movement for a better way. \nNow a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player. \nI decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. \n Thank you. \nAnd that way I can have a greater impact on the world. \nThis man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. \nSince I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day. \nThis man, this \"lunatic farmer,\" doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified seeds. \nAnd so for that, he's called crazy by the system. \nI want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life. \nSome people say organic or local food is more expensive, but is it really? \nWith all these things I've been learning about the food system, it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital. \n Now I know definitely which one I would choose. \nI want you to know that there are farms out there -- like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee -- whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. \nSometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer, so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. \nI want you to know that I believe if they know more about it and where it really comes from. \nI want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. \nI want you to know that me, my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. \nI try to share this everywhere I go. \nNot too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal. \nHe asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes -- you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. \nMy little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. \nAnd that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time. \nSo next time you're at the grocery store, think local, choose organic, know your farmer and know your food. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"Hello.

{"src_passage":"  Thank you. \n Thank you very much. \nThat was whistling. \nI'm trying to do this in English. \nWhat is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling? \nWell actually, I've [been] whistling since the age of four, about four. \nMy dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. \nSo I whistled along with him. \nAnd actually, till I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. \nI whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. \nI whistled on [my] bike. I whistled everywhere. \nAnd I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. \nAnd they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. \nAnd when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better. \nSo \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" -- you know it? \n But it can also sound like this. \n But during a Christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it's very annoying. \nSo my sister-in-law asked me a few times, \"Please stop whistling.\" \nAnd I just couldn't. \nAnd at one point -- and I had some wine, I have to admit that -- at one point I said, \"If there was a contest, I would join.\" \nAnd two weeks later I received a text message: \"You're going to America.\" \n So, okay, I'm going to America. \nI would love to, but why? \nSo I immediately called her up, of course. \nShe Googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course. \nShe didn't expect me to go there. \nAnd I would have lost my face. \nI don't know if that's correct English. \nBut the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. \n I lost my face. \n And she thought, \"He will never go there.\" \nBut actually I did. \nSo I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast United States, and I entered the world of whistling. \nAnd I also entered the world championship, and I won there in 2004. \n That was great fun, of course. \nAnd to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005, and I won again. \nThen I couldn't participate for a few years. \nAnd in 2008 I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. \nSo what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. \nAnd actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. \nSo I quit my day job as a nurse. \n And I try to live my dream -- well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good. \n Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here. \nYou say, \"Huh, what do you mean?\" \nWell actually, you are going to whistle along. \nAnd then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, \"Oh, my God. \nWhy?

Thank you. \n","predictions":"  Thank you. \n Thank you very much. \nThat was whistling. \nI'm trying to do this in English. \nWhat is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling? \nWell actually, I've [been] whistling since the age of four, about four. \nMy dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. \nSo I whistled along with him. \nAnd actually, till I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. \nI whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. \nI whistled on [my] bike. I whistled everywhere. \nAnd I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. \nAnd they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. \nAnd when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better. \nSo \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" -- you know it? \n But it can also sound like this. \n But during a Christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it's very annoying. \nSo my sister-in-law asked me a few times, \"Please stop whistling.\" \nAnd I just couldn't. \nAnd at one point -- and I had some wine, I have to admit that -- at one point I said, \"If there was a contest, I would join.\" \nAnd two weeks later I received a text message: \"You're going to America.\" \n So, okay, I'm going to America. \nI would love to, but why? \nSo I immediately called her up, of course. \nShe Googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course. \nShe didn't expect me to go there. \nAnd I would have lost my face. \nI don't know if that's correct English. \nBut the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. \n I lost my face. \n And she thought, \"He will never go there.\" \nBut actually I did. \nSo I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast United States, and I entered the world of whistling. \nAnd I also entered the world championship, and I won there in 2004. \n That was great fun, of course. \nAnd to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005, and I won again. \nThen I couldn't participate for a few years. \nAnd in 2008 I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. \nSo what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. \nAnd actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. \nSo I quit my day job as a nurse. \n And I try to live my dream -- well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good. \n Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here. \nYou say, \"Huh, what do you mean?\" \nWell actually, you are going to whistle along. \nAnd then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, \"Oh, my God. \nWhy? Can I go away?\" \nNo, you can't. \nActually it's very simple. \nThe track that I will whistle is called \"Fête de la Belle.\" \nIt's about 80 minutes long. \nNo, no, no. It's four minutes long. \nAnd I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. \nSo I whistle the tone. \n  Sorry.

We can make great little sculptures with these. \nBut the really cool thing about them is when we put them together. \nYou see that really salty Play-Doh? \nWell, it conducts electricity. \nAnd this is nothing new. \nIt turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years. \nBut our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh. \nAnd that sugar dough? \nWell it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. \nSo what does that mean? \nWell it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own. \n And so I want to do a little demo for you. \nSo if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in -- it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up. \nBut if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit. \nIf I push these together, the light turns off. \nRight, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED. \nIf I separate them again, I have some light. \nWell now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. \nIt's like a wall to the electricity. \nIf I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light. \nIn fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures. \nIf I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning. \n And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. \nWe call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids. \nI plug in again the power to it. \nAnd now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits. \nI can start plugging in lots of lights. \nAnd we can start talking about things like electrical load. \nWhat happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor? \nIt'll dim. \nWe can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done. \nYou could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. \nSo this is all in your home kitchen. \nWe've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab. \nWe have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes. \nWe've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. \nAnd it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone. \nWe've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii. \nSo I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing. \nWe don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should. \nHave fun.

{"src_passage":"So today, I want us to reflect on the demise of guys. \nGuys are flaming out academically; they're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women. \nOther than that, there's not much of a problem. \nSo what's the data? \nSo the data on dropping out is amazing. \nBoys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school. \nIn Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls. \nGirls outperform boys now at every level, from elementary school to graduate school. \nThere's a 10 percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs, with guys falling behind girls. \nTwo-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys. \nAnd as you all know, boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder -- and therefore we drug them with Ritalin. \nWhat's the evidence of wiping out? \nFirst, it's a new fear of intimacy. \nIntimacy means physical, emotional connection with somebody else -- and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous, contradictory, phosphorescent signals. \n And every year there's research done on self-reported shyness among college students. \nAnd we're seeing a steady increase among males. \nAnd this is two kinds. \nIt's a social awkwardness. \nThe old shyness was a fear of rejection. \nIt's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land. \nThey don't know what to say, they don't know what to do, especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex. \nThey don't know the language of face contact, the non-verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else, listen to somebody else. \nThere's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome, which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating. \nIt turns out, from earliest childhood, boys, and then men, prefer the company of guys -- physical company. \nAnd there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at, because guys have been with guys in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities, especially in the military, and then in pubs. \nAnd this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers, watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers, rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom. \nThe problem is they now prefer [the] asynchronistic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships. \nWhat are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence. \nI think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming, excessive new access to pornography. \nThe problem is these are arousal addictions. \nDrug addiction, you simply want more. \nArousal addiction, you want different. \nDrugs, you want more of the same -- different. \nSo you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained. \nAnd the problem is the industry is supplying it. \nJane McGonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is 21, he's played 10,000 hours of video games, most of that in isolation. \nAs you remember, Cindy Gallop said men don't know the difference between making love and doing porn. \nThe average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week. \nAnd there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously. \n And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America -- 15 billion annually. \nFor every 400 movies made in Hollywood, there are 11,000 now made porn videos. \nSo the effect, very quickly, is it's a new kind of arousal. \nBoys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal. \nThat means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes, which are analog, static, interactively passive. \nThey're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships, which build gradually and subtly. \nSo what's the solution? It's not my job. \nI'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve. \n  But who should care? The only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls, educators, gamers, filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to, who can dance, who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs. \nNo offense to banana slug owners.

{"src_passage":"When I graduated UCLA, I moved to northern California, and I lived in a little town called Elk on the Mendocino coast, and I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had U.S. mail, and life was good back then, if you could remember it. \nI'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie, and I'd ship my film to San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later, it would end up on my front door, which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood.  I didn't have much money, but I had time and a sense of wonder.  So I started shooting time-lapse photography. \nIt would take me a month to shoot a four-minute roll of film, because that's all I could afford. \nI've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously, non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 30 years, and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of. \nTheir beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch. \nIt also provides a third of the food we eat. \n Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival, because we protect what we fall in love with. \nIt opens our hearts, and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it. \nWhen we see ourselves in nature, it also connects us to every one of us, because it's clear that it's all connected in one. \nWhen people see my images, a lot of times they'll say, \"Oh my God.\" Have you ever wondered what that meant? \nThe \"oh\" means it caught your attention, makes you present, makes you mindful. \nThe \"my\" means it connects with something deep inside your soul. \nIt creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard.

I didn't have much money, but I had time and a sense of wonder.  So I started shooting time-lapse photography. \nIt would take me a month to shoot a four-minute roll of film, because that's all I could afford. \nI've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously, non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 30 years, and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of. \nTheir beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch. \nIt also provides a third of the food we eat. \n Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival, because we protect what we fall in love with. \nIt opens our hearts, and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it. \nWhen we see ourselves in nature, it also connects us to every one of us, because it's clear that it's all connected in one. \nWhen people see my images, a lot of times they'll say, \"Oh my God.\" Have you ever wondered what that meant? \nThe \"oh\" means it caught your attention, makes you present, makes you mindful. \nThe \"my\" means it connects with something deep inside your soul. \nIt creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard.

{"src_passage":"Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play. \nI won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens. \nI didn't realize there was going to be a little music before. \nSo I think I'm going to start with what I just heard. \n  Okay, so first of all, let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,  Burniss Travis on the bass,  and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano. \n So the bandstand, as we call it, this is an incredible space. \nIt is really a sacred space. \nAnd one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future, or the past. \nYou really are alive right here in this moment. \nwhen you walk on the bandstand. \nWe had no idea what key we were going to play in. \nIn the middle, we sort of made our way into a song called \"Titi Boom.\" \nBut that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not. \nEveryone's listening. We're responding. \nYou have no time for projected ideas. \nSo the idea of a mistake: From the perspective of a jazz musician, it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake. \nSo the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand -- first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake. \nThe only mistake lies in that I'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did. \nEvery \"mistake\" is an opportunity in jazz. \nSo it's hard to even describe what a funny note would be. \nSo for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette, that sounded like this ... \n So if Christian played a note -- like play an F. \n See, these are all right inside of the color palette. \nIf you played an E. \nSee, these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting. \nIf you played an F# though,  to most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake. \nSo I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second. \nAnd we're going to play on this palette. \nAnd at some point, Christian will introduce this note. \nAnd we won't react to it. \nHe'll introduce it for a second and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second. \nWe'll see what happens when we play with this palette. \n So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake. \nThe only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it. \nIt was an opportunity that was missed. \nSo it's unpredictable.

One, two, a one, two, three, four. \n Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas. \nIt's much more organic.

just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft. \nNow rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin, and then to Mars ... \n ... if we use pennies. \nNow this is obviously a powerful, some might say dangerously powerful, insight. \nBut it's also a morally important one. \nBecause this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about, but this is actual economic losses. \nThis is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops, as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum. \nBut identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math. \nNow music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year So that's a chunk of what we're looking for. \nBut total movie revenues across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up. \nAnd TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up. \nOther content markets like book publishing and radio are also up. \nSo this small missing chunk here is puzzling. \n  Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms, it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented, but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the 90's. \nWhat we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy. \n 50 billion dollars of it a year, which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone, that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. \n It's true. \n I have Excel. \n The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft, which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people. \nOther data has the music industry at about 45,000 people. \nAnd so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft, have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. \nAnd this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. \nAnd some people think that string theory is tough. \n Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. \nIt's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. \nHollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. \nSome people think this number's a little bit large, but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year. \nNow when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. \nAnd it was a big Christmas hit. \nBecause what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket. \n  These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs, which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media. \n Or about 75,000 jobs. \n  Now you might

It won't tell you anything. \nAnd this all changed in the late 19th century. \nSuddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring. \nThe computer was cracked open. \nSo what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain. \nAnd it works in a very particular way. \nInstead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them. \nIt clears the forest, reveals the trees inside. \nIf everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible. \nSo somehow it shows what's there. \nSpanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience, applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this, and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron. \nAnd if you're thinking of the brain as a computer, this is the transistor. \nAnd very quickly Cajal realized that neurons don't operate alone, but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer. \nToday, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons, they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them. \nAnd there's several ways of doing this. \nBut one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein. \nNow green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful. \nBecause if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors. \nAnd so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called \"Brainbow.\" \nAnd it's so called, of course, because all of these neurons are glowing different colors. \nNow sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons, molecules, rather than the entire cell. \nAnd there's several ways of doing this, but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies. \nAnd you're familiar, of course, with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system. \nBut it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, of a virus that's invading the body. \nAnd researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually. \nAnd a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful, but they're also very powerful. \nThey have great explanatory power. \nThis, for example, is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain. \nAnd you've heard of serotonin, of course, in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety. \nYou've heard of SSRIs, which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases. \nAnd in order to understand how serotonin works, it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is. \nAnd antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question. \nI'd like to leave you with the following thought: Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get-go. \nThey were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason, or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example. \nAnd only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say, \"Hey, these are tools, these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette.\" \nAnd instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch, there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain. \nIt's a diagram of the visual system. \nAnd

with the brain. \nNobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring. \nAnd that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it, put it under even a very powerful microscope, there's nothing there. \nIt's gray, formless. \nThere's no structure. It won't tell you anything. \nAnd this all changed in the late 19th century. \nSuddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring. \nThe computer was cracked open. \nSo what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain. \nAnd it works in a very particular way. \nInstead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them. \nIt clears the forest, reveals the trees inside. \nIf everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible. \nSo somehow it shows what's there. \nSpanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience, applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this, and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron. \nAnd if you're thinking of the brain as a computer, this is the transistor. \nAnd very quickly Cajal realized that neurons don't operate alone, but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer. \nToday, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons, they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them. \nAnd there's several ways of doing this. \nBut one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein. \nNow green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful. \nBecause if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors. \nAnd so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called \"Brainbow.\" \nAnd it's so called, of course, because all of these neurons are glowing different colors. \nNow sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons, molecules, rather than the entire cell. \nAnd there's several ways of doing this, but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies. \nAnd you're familiar, of course, with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system. \nBut it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, of a virus that's invading the body. \nAnd researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually. \nAnd a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful, but they're also very powerful. \nThey have great explanatory power. \nThis, for example, is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain. \nAnd you've heard of serotonin, of course, in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety. \nYou've heard of SSRIs, which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases. \nAnd in order to understand how serotonin works, it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is. \nAnd antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question. \nI'd like to leave you with the following thought: Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get-go. \nThey were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason, or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example. \nAnd only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say, \"Hey, these are tools, these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette.\" \nAnd instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch, there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all. \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":1274,"num_sentence":52}

So instead, I turned to video, and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time. \nSo what I did was, I filmed six of my friends and then, using video mapping and video projection, I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends projected into jars.  So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me whenever I go, and this is called Animalia Chordata, from the Latin nomenclature for human being, classification system. \nSo this piece memorializes my friends in these jars, and they actually move around.  So, this is interesting to me, but it lacked a certain human element.  It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add an interaction system. So what I did was, I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways. \nYou know, just like people on the street when you get too close to them. \nSome people reacted in terror.  Others reacted in asking you for help, and some people hide from you. \nSo this was really interesting to me, this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life, and also adding interactivity to sculpture. \nSo over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as Garden, which is literally a garden of humanity. \nBut something about the first piece, the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me, this idea of interaction with art, and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact, and also being challenged by interacting with art. \nSo I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something, and the way I did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender.  This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art. \nYou may never experience the entire thing yourself. \nYou can walk away, you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you, or you can actually choose to interact with it. \nSo if you do choose to interact with the piece, and you press the blender button, it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment. \nBy doing that, you are now part of my piece. \nYou, like the people that are trapped in my work —  — have become part of my work as well.    But, but this seems a bit unfair, right? \nI put my friends in jars, I put this character, this sort of endangered species character in a blender. \nBut I'd never done anything about myself. \nI'd never really memorialized myself. \nSo I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece. \nThis is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed, in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock, and it's up to you. \nIf you want to choose to punch that punch card clock, you actually age me. \nSo I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock, you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler, and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager. \nFrom a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self. \nFrom my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man, and then, from there, into an elderly man. \nAnd if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day, the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day. \nSo, in doing so, you're erasing time. \nYou're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. \nSo I like this about interactive video sculpture, that you can actually interact with it, that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves, and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars.  Thank you.  \n","predictions":"I love to collect things. \nEver since I was a kid, I've had massive collections of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars. \nNow, it's no secret, because I like collecting things, that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas. \nThese, to me, are like living sculptures, right, that you can go and look at, and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life. \nSo I was thinking about my own life, and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know, for the ages, and also —  — the lives of my friends, but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them.

{"src_passage":"To understand the world that live in, we tell stories. \nAnd while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it, all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online. \nBut video has been left out. It arrived on the web in a small box, and there it has remained, completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it. \nIn fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture. \nPopcorn changes all of that. \nIt's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web. \nVideos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself: dynamic, full of links, and completely remixable, and finally allowed to break free from the frame. \nI want to give you a demo of a prototype that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall. \nIt will be completely free, and it will work in any browser. \nSo, every Popcorn production begins with the video, and so I've made a short, 20-second clip using a newscaster template that we use in workshops. \nSo let's watch it. We'll go back, and I'll show you how we made it. \nHi, and welcome to my newscast. \nI've added my location with a Google Map, and it's live, so try moving it around. \nYou can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons, or pull in content from any web service, like Flickr, or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content. \nSo let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there. \nSo this is the timeline, and if you've ever edited video, you're familiar with this, but instead of clips in the timeline, what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video. \nNow in this Popcorn production we've got the title card, we've got a Google Map that shows up picture-in-picture, then Popcorn lets it push outside the frame and take over the whole screen. \nThere are two pop-ups bringing you some other information, and a final article with a link out to the original article. \nLet's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it. \nAll you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item, and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from. \nLet's set it to something else. \nPopcorn immediately goes out onto the web, talks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display. \nAnd it's exactly the same for the people who watch your production. \nAnd it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it, you zoom in, right down to street view if you want to. \nNow in the video, I mentioned adding a live feed, which we can do right now, so let's add a live feed from Flickr. Go over to the right-hand side, grab Flickr from the list of options, drag it into the timeline, and put it where you'd like it to go, and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags. Now, my developers really like ponies, and so they've set that as the default tag. \nLet's try something else, maybe something a bit more relevant to today. \nNow here are live images being pulled straight from the feed. \nIf you come and watch this a week from now, this will be completely different, dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web, everything is sourced, so click your link, and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image. \nEverything you've seen today is built with the basic building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. \nThat means it's completely remixable. It also means there's no proprietary software. All you need is a web browser. \nSo imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web, completely remixable, linked to its source content, and interactive for everyone who views it. \nI think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web, and the way we understand the world we live in. \nThank you.  \n","predictions":"To understand the world that live in, we tell stories. \nAnd while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it, all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online. \nBut video has been left out.

We'll go back, and I'll show you how we made it. \nHi, and welcome to my newscast. \nI've added my location with a Google Map, and it's live, so try moving it around. \nYou can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons, or pull in content from any web service, like Flickr, or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content. \nSo let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there. \nSo this is the timeline, and if you've ever edited video, you're familiar with this, but instead of clips in the timeline, what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video. \nNow in this Popcorn production we've got the title card, we've got a Google Map that shows up picture-in-picture, then Popcorn lets it push outside the frame and take over the whole screen. \nThere are two pop-ups bringing you some other information, and a final article with a link out to the original article. \nLet's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it. \nAll you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item, and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from. \nLet's set it to something else. \nPopcorn immediately goes out onto the web, talks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display. \nAnd it's exactly the same for the people who watch your production. \nAnd it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it, you zoom in, right down to street view if you want to. \nNow in the video, I mentioned adding a live feed, which we can do right now, so let's add a live feed from Flickr. Go over to the right-hand side, grab Flickr from the list of options, drag it into the timeline, and put it where you'd like it to go, and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags. Now, my developers really like ponies, and so they've set that as the default tag. \nLet's try something else, maybe something a bit more relevant to today. \nNow here are live images being pulled straight from the feed. \nIf you come and watch this a week from now, this will be completely different, dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web, everything is sourced, so click your link, and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image. \nEverything you've seen today is built with the basic building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. \nThat means it's completely remixable. It also means there's no proprietary software. All you need is a web browser. \nSo imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web, completely remixable, linked to its source content, and interactive for everyone who views it. \nI think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web, and the way we understand the world we live in. \nThank you.  \n","num_tokens":1024,"num_sentence":42}

{"src_passage":"Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city, We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go, the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks, we realized something. Military veterans are very, very good at disaster response. \nAnd coming home, my cofounder and I, we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems. \nThe first problem is there's inadequate disaster response. \nIt's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology, and it's not using the best people. \nThe second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration, and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life. \nAnd we sat here and we looked at these two problems, and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems. \nThese are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that? \nWell, we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home. \nRecent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform. \nAnd we can use veterans to improve disaster response. \nNow on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010, we responded to the tsunami in Chile, the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border. \nBut it was earlier this year, when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. \nThis is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me. \nWe served together in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nClay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile. \nEarlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life. \nThis was a tragedy, but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing. \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself because of what he lost when he came home. \nHe lost purpose. He lost his community. \nAnd perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth. \nAnd so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems -- in the initial iteration of our organization, we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service. We had a lot of success, and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm. \nBut after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly, now moving forward, we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response. \nBecause we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran. \nAnd tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that. \nNow I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri. \nHe joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. \nThey send him to Iraq. \nEvery day he leaves the wire with a mission. \nThat mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home. \nIt's to keep the men around him alive. \nIt's to pacify the village that he works in. \nHe's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri, maybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job, but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose. \nYou give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri after a tornado, he regains that. \nGoing back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army, the Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq. \nEvery day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him. \nHe leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back. \nHe's slept in the same sand. They've lived together. \nThey've eaten together. They've bled together. \nHe goes home to Kansas City, Missouri. \nHe gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off. \nHe doesn't have that community anymore. \nBut you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri, they get that sense of community back. \nAgain, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates high school in Kansas City. \nHe joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. \nThey send him to Iraq. \nThey pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade. \nHe takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City. \nHe doesn't have that same self-worth. \nBut you send him to Joplin after a tornado, and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service, now they have self-worth again. \nI think it's very important, because right now somebody needs to step up, and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance. \nThank you very much.  \n","predictions":"Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city, We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go, the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks, we realized something. Military veterans are very, very good at disaster response. \nAnd coming home, my cofounder and I, we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems. \nThe first problem is there's inadequate disaster response. \nIt's slow. It's antiquated.

{"src_passage":"So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema. \nWater and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing. \nThe Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter. \nSo as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says, \"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?\" \nAnd I sat, and I was like, \"Man, I would buy that, eh?\" \nSo I went home, and I did a little research, and I found some very shocking statistics. \nOver 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation. \nFour hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa, and five million of them are in South Africa. \nVarious diseases thrive in this environment, the most drastic of which is called trachoma. \nTrachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind. \nThe disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face: no medicine, no pills, no injections. \nSo after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself, \"Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need to do it to try to save the world.\"  So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone -- I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much, except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — \nI did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions, creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities -- I did high school science -- and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper, and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know? \nSo I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready. \nNow we need to get this thing into practice. \nFast forward four years later, after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone, having written my patent on the cell phone, I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country, and —  — I can't say any more than that.  I had invented DryBath, the world's first bath-substituting lotion. \nYou literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe. \n So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had, I went to university, met a few people, got it into practice, and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market. It's actually available on the market. \nSo we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available. \nOne of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk. \nThey buy products on demand. A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette each day, even though it's more expensive. \nSo we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets. \nYou just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out. \nAnd the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand. \nAfter creating that model, we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product. \nWe realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath.  At least once a week. \nAnyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid. \nAfter seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down to our key value proposition, which was cleanliness and convenience. \nDryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver. \nHaving put the product into practice, we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market, and one question I have for the audience today is, on the gravel roads of Limpopo, with an allowance of 50 rand a week, I came up with a way for the world not to bathe. \nWhat's stopping you?  I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. \nthroughout this whole process, last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world. \nI'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world, the first African to get that accolade, and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe.

It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV. \nIn fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate. \nNow, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton: promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product launches, territorial expansion. \nBut they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days. \nFor the most part, everyone was just trying to survive. \nIt's a lot harder than you might think. \nContrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life. \nYou've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it. \nAnd it's hard for a couple of reasons. \nFirst, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you don't make a lot of money. \nI unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job, unloading trucks at a food warehouse, for $5.25, not an hour, but per month. \nSo how do you survive? \nWell, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles. \nThere's legal hustles. \nYou pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency. \nYou charge another inmate to clean his cell. \nThere's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell. \nThere's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell. \nAnd there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be. \nYou want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars. \nYou want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks. \nYou want a dirty magazine? \nWell, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars. \nSo as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity. \nWhether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses. \nBut there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even. \nAnd then, when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background. \nSo none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years. \nLook, I lied to the Feds.

it had changed who I was on a core level. \nA part of me had become alienated from myself. \nI was seeing myself not from my perspective, but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other

started using a wheelchair, by creating unexpected images. \nThe wheelchair became an object to paint and play with. \nWhen I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom, it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people. \nIt seemed to open up new perspectives, and therein lay the paradigm shift. \nIt showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and

This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain. \nIt was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called \"Cloudburst,\" which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment. \nNow fast forward to just three years ago. \n And we released to YouTube this, the Virtual Choir Project, 185 singers from 12 different countries. \nYou can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home. \nTwo years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called \"Sleep.\" \nAnd then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3, \"Water Night,\" another piece that I had written, this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries. \n And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could. \nCould we do this all in real time? \nCould we have people singing together in real time? \nAnd with the help of Skype, that is what we are going to attempt today. \nNow, we'll perform \"Cloudburst\" for you. \nThe first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage. \nI'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and —  -- and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries. \nNow, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go, but there's still less than a second of latency, but in musical terms, that's a lifetime. \nWe deal in milliseconds. \nSo what I've done is, I've adapted \"Cloudburst\" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together. \nSo with deep humility, and for your approval, we present \"Cloudburst.\" \n  [The rain ...] [Eyes of shadow-water] [eyes of well-water] [eyes of dream-water.] [Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.] [But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?] [Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?] [The rain awakens...] [We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.] \n[We must dream aloud,] [we must sing till the song puts forth roots,] [trunk, branches, birds, stars.] [We must find the lost word,] [and remember what the blood,] [the tides, the earth, and the body say,] [and return to the point of departure...]   [\"Cloudburst\" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre] Eric Whitacre: Beth.

{"src_passage":"I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at. \nYou're about to experience a new, available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives. \nWhat I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material. \nIt's called Ultra-Ever Dry, and when you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. \nSo this is a cinder block, uncoated, and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water. \nNot anymore. \nPorous, nonporous. \nSo what's superhydrophobic? \nSuperhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface. \nThe rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is, and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic. \nA freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees. \nA windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees. \nBut what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees, and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic. \nSo as part of the demonstration, what I have is a pair of gloves, and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating, and let's see if you can tell which one, and I'll give you a hint. \nDid you guess the one that was dry? \nWhen you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits. \nAnd we're talking really small here. \nThe way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers, and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and to put some scale to that, if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick, and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the width of a human hair. \nSo very small, but very useful. \nAnd it's not just water that this works with. \nIt's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well. \nYou can see the difference. \nMoving onto the next demonstration, we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating, and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle, and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops, and I can't even coax it to leave. \nIt's that afraid of the water. \n So what's going on here? What's happening? \nWell, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. \nYou'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not. \nAnd it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air. \nIt's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off. \nSo if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it, and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry. \nSo what are the applications? \nI mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head. \nEveryone that sees this gets excited, and says, \"Oh, I could use it for this and this and this.\" \nThe applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti-wetting. \nWe've certainly seen that today. \nIt could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice. \nIt could be anti-corrosion. \nNo water, no corrosion. \nIt could be anti-bacterial. \nWithout water, the bacteria won't survive. \nAnd it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well. \nSo imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. \nAnd I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration, but before I do that, I would like to say thank you, and think small. \n It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it. \nChris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED?

{"src_passage":"All right, so let's take four subjects that obviously go together: big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks. \nRight? \nNow, the issue about tattoos is that, without a word, tattoos really do shout. \n[Beautiful] [Intriguing] So you don't have to say a lot. \n[Allegiance] [Very intimate] [Serious mistakes]  And tattoos tell you a lot of stories. \nIf I can ask an indiscreet question, how many of you have tattoos? \nA few, but not most. \nWhat happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor, all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos? \nAnd what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would? \nWhat's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting, blogging, following you, watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself. \nAnd electronic tattoos also shout. \nAnd as you're thinking of the consequences of that, it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things, because it's not just the electronic tattoos, it's facial recognition that's getting really good. \nSo you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes.  But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this, take a picture, say, of this guy right here, get the name, and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody, because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos. \nAnd so there's companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online. \nHere's what happened to this company. \n[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...] There are other companies that will place a camera like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook — they take your picture, they tie it to the social media, they figure out you really like to wear black dresses, so maybe the person in the store comes up and says, \"Hey, we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you.\" \nSo what if Andy was wrong? \nHere's Andy's theory. \n[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.] What if we flip this? \nWhat if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes?

He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time to roll this rock up, it would roll back down, roll back up, roll back down. \nIt's a little like your reputation. \nOnce you get that electronic tattoo, you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time, so as you go through this stuff, just be careful what you post. \nMyth number two: Orpheus, wonderful guy, charming to be around, great partier, great singer, loses his beloved, charms his way into the underworld, only person to charm his way into the underworld, charms the gods of the underworld, they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they're out. \nSo he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever. \nWith all this data out here, it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love. \nLesson number three: Atalanta. \nGreatest runner.

He eventually won the race. \nJust remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late-night message. \nAnd then, of course, there's Narcissus. \nNobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus. \n But as you're thinking about Narcissus, just don't fall in love with your own reflection. \nLast lesson, from a Latin American: This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges. \nWhen he was threatened by the thugs of the Argentine military junta, he came back and said, \"Oh, come on, how else can you threaten, other than with death?\" \nThe interesting thing, the original thing, would be to threaten somebody with immortality. \nAnd that, of course, is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"All right, so let's take four subjects that obviously go together: big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks. \nRight? \nNow, the issue about tattoos is that, without a word, tattoos really do shout. \n[Beautiful] [Intriguing] So you don't have to say a lot. \n[Allegiance] [Very intimate] [Serious mistakes]  And tattoos tell you a lot of stories. \nIf I can ask an indiscreet question, how many of you have tattoos? \nA few, but not most. \nWhat happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor, all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos? \nAnd what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would? \nWhat's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting, blogging, following you, watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself. \nAnd electronic tattoos also shout. \nAnd as you're thinking of the consequences of that, it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things, because it's not just the electronic tattoos, it's facial recognition that's getting really good. \nSo you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes.

{"src_passage":"I teach chemistry. \n All right, all right. \nSo more than just explosions, chemistry is everywhere. \nHave you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over? \nSome people nodding yes. \nRecently, I showed this to my students, and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened. \nThe questions and conversations that followed were fascinating. \nCheck out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening. \n  Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher, I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class. \nBut what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level. \nIf you look inside that beaker, you might see a candle. \nMaddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario. \nYou know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers, and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education. \nBut if we place these technologies before student inquiry, we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions. \nFor example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time, but if it is the focus of our students' experience, it's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing. \nBut if instead we have the guts to confuse our students, perplex them, and evoke real questions, through those questions, we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction. \nSo, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside, the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now, and it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning, not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information. \nIn May of 2010, at 35 years old, with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way, I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta. \nThis led to open-heart surgery.

We know learning is ugly. \nAnd just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip, okay, trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206. \nAnd rule number three: Practice reflection. \nWhat we do is important.

{"src_passage":"Francesca Fedeli: Ciao. \nSo he's Mario. He's our son. \nHe was born two and a half years ago, and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for, like, eight months. \nBut in the end everything seemed to be under control. \nSo he got the right weight at birth. \nHe got the right Apgar index. \nSo we were pretty reassured by this. \nBut at the end, 10 days later after he was born, we discovered that he had a stroke. \nAs you might know, a stroke is a brain injury. \nA perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth, and in his case, as you can see, the right part of his brain has gone. \nSo the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body could be the fact that he couldn't be able to control the left side of his body. \nJust imagine, if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit, to input to print out a document, but the printer doesn't have the right drives, so the same is for Mario. \nIt's just like, he would like to move his left side of his body, but he's not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg. \nSo life had to change. \nWe needed to change our schedule. \nWe needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life. \nRoberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine, unfortunately, we were not ready. \nNobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities, and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds. \nAnd that has been really a tough time. \nQuestions, some basics, like, you know, why did this happen to us? \nAnd what went wrong? \nSome more tough, like, really, what will be the impact on Mario's life? \nI mean, at the end, will he be able to work? \nWill he be able to be normal? \nAnd, you know, as a parent, especially for the first time, why is he not going to be better than us? \nAnd this, indeed, really is tough to say, but a few months later, we realized that we were really feeling like a failure. \nI mean, the only real product of our life, at the end, was a failure. \nAnd you know, it was not a failure for ourselves in itself, but it was a failure that will impact his full life. \nHonestly, we went down. \nI mean we went really down, but at the end, we started to look at him, and we said, we have to react. \nSo immediately, as Francesca said, we changed our life. \nWe started physiotherapy, we started the rehabilitation, and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot. \nBasically, we spent months doing this with Mario. \nYou have an object, and we showed him how to grab the object. \nNow, the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains, exactly now, as you watch me doing this, you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions. \nIt looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation. \nBut one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand. \nHe was looking at us. \nWe were his mirror. \nAnd the problem, as you might feel, is that we were down, we were depressed, we were looking at him as a problem, not as a son, not from a positive perspective. \nAnd that day really changed our perspective. \nWe realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario. \nWe restarted from our strengths, and at the same time we restarted from his strengths. \nWe stopped looking at him as a problem, and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve. \nAnd really, this was the change, and from our side, we said, \"What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario?\" \nAnd we started from our passions. \nI mean, at the end, my wife and myself are quite different, but we have many things in common. \nWe love to travel, we love music, we love to be in places like this, and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him. \nThis short video is from last week. \nI am not saying --  — I am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message, because we are just at the beginning of the path. \nBut we want to share what was the key learning, the key learning that Mario drove to us, and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss, and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity. \nAnd this is the message that we want to share with you. \nThis is why we are here. \nMario! \nAnd this is why --  — And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him. \nAnd we thank you so much, all of you. \nFF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye. \n FF: Thank you.  \n","predictions":"Francesca Fedeli: Ciao. \nSo he's Mario. He's our son. \nHe was born two and a half years ago, and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for, like, eight months. \nBut in the end everything seemed to be under control. \nSo he got the right weight at birth. \nHe got the right Apgar index. \nSo we were pretty reassured by this. \nBut at the end, 10 days later after he was born, we discovered that he had a stroke. \nAs you might know, a stroke is a brain injury. \nA perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth, and in his case, as you can see, the right part of his brain has gone. \nSo the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body could be the fact that he couldn't be able to control the left side of his body. \nJust imagine, if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit, to input to print out a document, but the printer doesn't have the right drives, so the same is for Mario. \nIt's just like, he would like to move his left side of his body, but he's not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg. \nSo life had to change. \nWe needed to change our schedule. \nWe needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life. \nRoberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine, unfortunately, we were not ready. \nNobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities, and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds. \nAnd that has been really a tough time. \nQuestions, some basics, like, you know, why did this happen to us? \nAnd what went wrong? \nSome more tough, like, really, what will be the impact on Mario's life? \nI mean, at the end, will he be able to work? \nWill he be able to be normal? \nAnd, you know, as a parent, especially for the first time, why is he not going to be better than us? \nAnd this, indeed, really is tough to say, but a few months later, we realized that we were really feeling like a failure. \nI mean, the only real product of our life, at the end, was a failure. \nAnd you know, it was not a failure for ourselves in itself, but it was a failure that will impact his full life. \nHonestly, we went down. \nI mean we went really down, but at the end, we started to look at him, and we said, we have to react. \nSo immediately, as Francesca said, we changed our life. \nWe started physiotherapy, we started the rehabilitation, and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot. \nBasically, we spent months doing this with Mario. \nYou have an object, and we showed him how to grab the object. \nNow, the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains, exactly now, as you watch me doing this, you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions. \nIt looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation. \nBut one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand. \nHe was looking at us. \nWe were his mirror. \nAnd the problem, as you might feel, is that we were down, we were depressed, we were looking at him as a problem, not as a son, not from a positive perspective. \nAnd that day really changed our perspective. \nWe realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario. \nWe restarted from our strengths, and at the same time we restarted from his strengths. \nWe stopped looking at him as a problem, and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve. \nAnd really, this was the change, and from our side, we said, \"What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario?\" \nAnd we started from our passions. \nI mean, at the end, my wife and myself are quite different, but we have many things in common. \nWe love to travel, we love music, we love to be in places like this, and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him. \nThis short video is from last week. \nI am not saying --  — I am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message, because we are just at the beginning of the path. \nBut we want to share what was the key learning, the key learning that Mario drove to us, and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss, and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity. \nAnd this is the message that we want to share with you. \nThis is why we are here. \nMario! \nAnd this is why --  — And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him. \nAnd we thank you so much, all of you. \nFF: Thank you.

{"src_passage":"What do we know about the future? \nDifficult question, simple answer: nothing. \nWe cannot predict the future. \nWe only can create a vision of the future, how it might be, a vision which reveals disruptive ideas, which is inspiring, and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking. \nThere are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future, for instance, this vision here from the early 20th century. \nIt says here that this is the ocean plane of the future. \nIt takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean. \nToday, we know that this future vision didn't come true. \nSo this is our largest airplane which we have, the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge, so a lot of people fit in there and it's technically completely different than the vision I've shown to you. \nI'm working in a team with Airbus, and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation. \nSo sustainability is quite important for us, which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values. \nSo we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone, or a skeleton, which occurs in nature. \nSo that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird, especially to the people who deal with structures in general. \nBut at least it's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future. \nWhat are the main customers of the future? \nSo, we have the old, we have the young, we have the uprising power of women, and there's one mega-trend which affects all of us. \nThese are the future anthropometrics. \nSo our children are getting larger, but at the same time we are growing into different directions. \nSo what we need is space inside the aircraft, inside a very dense area. \nThese people have different needs. \nSo we see a clear need of active health promotion, especially in the case of the old people. \nWe want to be treated as individuals. \nWe like to be productive throughout the entire travel chain, and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latest man-machine interface, and we want to integrate this and show this in one product. \nSo we combined these needs with technology's themes. \nSo for instance, we are asking ourselves, how can we create more light? \nHow can we bring more natural light into the airplane? \nSo this airplane has no windows anymore, for example. \nWhat about the data and communication software which we need in the future? \nMy belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness. \nIt will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology. \nThis will be very different in the future. \nIt will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment. \nAnd then we are talking also about materials, synthetic biology, for example. \nAnd my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on, because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design. \nSo let's compare the old world with the new world. \nI just want to show you here what we are doing today. \nSo this is a bracket of an A380 crew rest compartment. \nIt takes a lot of weight, and it follows the classical design rules. \nThis here is an equal bracket for the same purpose. \nIt follows the design of bone. \nThe design process is completely different. \nAt the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos, and at the other hand 0.6 kilos. \nSo this technology, 3D printing, and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight, which is the biggest issue in aircraft design, because it's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions. \nPush this idea a little bit forward. \nSo how does nature build its components and structures? \nSo nature is very clever. It puts all the information into these small building blocks, which we call DNA. \nAnd nature builds large skeletons out of it. \nSo we see a bottom-up approach here, because all the information, as I said, are inside the DNA. \nAnd this is combined with a top-down approach, because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles, we train our skeleton, and it's getting stronger. \nAnd the same approach can be applied to technology as well. \nSo our building block is carbon nanotubes, for example, to create a large, rivet-less skeleton at the end of the day. \nHow this looks in particular, you can show it here. \nSo imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a 3D printer, and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic, and follow the forces which occur in your component. \nAnd you've got trillions of them. \nSo you really align them to wood, and you take this wood and make morphological optimization, so you make structures, sub-structures, which allows you to transmit electrical energy or data. \nAnd now we take this material, combine this with a top-down approach, and build bigger and bigger components. \nSo how might the airplane of the future look? \nSo we have very different seats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger, with the different anthropometrics. \nWe have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf. \nAnd finally, this bionic structure, which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane, will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future. \nSo as Jason Silva said, if we can imagine it, why not make it so? \nSee you in the future.

{"src_passage":"I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before: What is possible with the human voice? \nWhat is possible with the human voice? \n ♪ Ooh baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪  ♪ baby ♪  ♪ baby ♪   Yeah. \n  It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was, yeah. \nAs you can probably well imagine, I was a strange child. \n Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be. \nI was constantly experimenting with these noises. \nAnd I'm still on that mission. \nI'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. \nAnd the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do. \nAnd there's things that no one's voice can do. \nFor example, no one can do two notes at the same time. \nYou can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... \n But that's cheating. \nAnd it hurts your throat. \nSo there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me. \nIf only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it. \nSo I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine. \nWe've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. \nAnd I'm going to show you what it can do. \nAnd before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice. \nThis system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. \nSo once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. \nSo the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice. \nHow do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. \nThe simplest way to do it is something like this. \n By dancing. It's like this. \n Thanks. \n So that's probably the easiest way. \nBut if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up. \nThere's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like. \nSo I'm going to start another beat for you, like this. \n There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want. \nYou don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. \nI'm going to lay down a bass sound now. \n And now, a rockabilly guitar. \nWhich is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a --  -- Thanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ? \nIs that possible? Yes, it is, by recording myself like this. \n And now I have that, I have that recorded. \nAssign it to a keyboard. \n So that's cool. \n But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd? \nImpossible, you say. No. \nIt is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. \n So every noise you can hear there is my voice. \nI didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. \nThere's no samples. There's no synthesizers. \nThat is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point? \nWhy do this?

It was, yeah. \nAs you can probably well imagine, I was a strange child. \n Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be. \nI was constantly experimenting with these noises. \nAnd I'm still on that mission. \nI'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. \nAnd the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do. \nAnd there's things that no one's voice can do. \nFor example, no one can do two notes at the same time. \nYou can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... \n But that's cheating. \nAnd it hurts your throat. \nSo there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me. \nIf only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it. \nSo I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine. \nWe've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. \nAnd I'm going to show you what it can do. \nAnd before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice. \nThis system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. \nSo once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. \nSo the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice. \nHow do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. \nThe simplest way to do it is something like this. \n By dancing. It's like this. \n Thanks. \n So that's probably the easiest way. \nBut if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up. \nThere's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like. \nSo I'm going to start another beat for you, like this. \n There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want. \nYou don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. \nI'm going to lay down a bass sound now. \n And now, a rockabilly guitar. \nWhich is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a --  -- Thanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ? \nIs that possible? Yes, it is, by recording myself like this. \n And now I have that, I have that recorded. \nAssign it to a keyboard. \n So that's cool. \n But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd? \nImpossible, you say. No. \nIt is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. \n So every noise you can hear there is my voice. \nI didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. \nThere's no samples. There's no synthesizers. \nThat is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point? \nWhy do this?  Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd, I suppose, is the easy answer. \nBut in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist. \nI've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine. \nSo with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see. \n  Like this. \n So, loosely defined, that is what's possible with the human voice. \nThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. \n","num_tokens":1314,"num_sentence":71}

We learned a lot. \nWe kept prototyping, and eventually, we decided we wanted to go to the cave. We were ready. \nSo about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times. \nAnd we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. \nSo we decided to put the project on Kickstarter, and when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours, and all of a sudden, had this money to make these kits. \nBut then we had to learn how to make them. \nI mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing. \nSo we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. \nBut we were able to do it, we got all the kits made, thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us, and we shipped these kits all over the world so it was just a few months ago. \nBut we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world, including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica. \nWe've also learned the penguins love robots. \n So we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves. \nThat's the only way that we could have done this. \nBy being open source, we've created this distributed R&amp;D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart. \nBut the actual robot is really only half the story. \nThe real potential, the long term potential, is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. \nwhen there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas? \nSo you're probably all wondering: the cave. \nDid you find the gold? \nWell, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. \nIt was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration. \nIt's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in. \nIt's an underwater world we're all exploring together. \nThank you. \n","predictions":" So this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of Key Largo, about 60 feet below the surface. \nNASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts, and last year, they invited us along for the ride. \nAll the footage was taken from our open ROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage. \nSo ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside. \nIt's open source, meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online, allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design. \nIt's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic. \nSo ROVs aren't new. \nThey've been around for decades. \nScientists use ROVs to explore the oceans. \nOil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction. \nWhat we've built isn't unique. \nIt's how we've built it that's really unique. \nSo I want to give you a quick story of how it got started. \nSo a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. \nWe had heard this story about lost gold from a Gold Rush-era robbery, and we wanted to go up there. \nUnfortunately, we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. \nSo Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, but we didn't have all the parts figured out, so we did what anybody would do in our situation: we asked the Internet for help. \nMore specifically, we created this website, openROV.com, and shared our intentions and our plans For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums, but pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists, and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. \nWe kept working on it.

We were ready. \nSo about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times. \nAnd we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. \nSo we decided to put the project on Kickstarter, and when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours, and all of a sudden, had this money to make these kits. \nBut then we had to learn how to make them. \nI mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing. \nSo we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. \nBut we were able to do it, we got all the kits made, thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us, and we shipped these kits all over the world so it was just a few months ago. \nBut we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world, including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica. \nWe've also learned the penguins love robots. \n So we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves. \nThat's the only way that we could have done this. \nBy being open source, we've created this distributed R&amp;D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart. \nBut the actual robot is really only half the story. \nThe real potential, the long term potential, is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. \nwhen there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas? \nSo you're probably all wondering: the cave. \nDid you find the gold? \nWell, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. \nIt was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration. \nIt's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in. \nIt's an underwater world we're all exploring together. \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":1063,"num_sentence":45}
{"src_passage":" For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City, these shots might start to look familiar. \nThis is Central Park, one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in America. \nBut to anyone who hasn't visited, these images can't really fully convey. \nTo really understand Central Park, you have to physically be there. \nWell, the same is true of the music, which my brother and I composed and mapped  I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing -- That's us there. That's both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years, this idea of location-aware music. \nNow, my brother and I, we're musicians and music producers. \nWe've been working together since, well, since we were kids, really. \nBut recently, we've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect, from creating sight-specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts. \nBut today I want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space. \nBut before I go too much further into that, let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea. \nMy brother and I were living in New York City when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude did their temporary installation, The Gates, in Central Park. \nHundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks, and unlike work that's exhibited in a more neutral space, like on the walls of a gallery or a museum, this was work that was really in dialogue with this place, and in a lot of ways, The Gates was really a celebration of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design. \nThis was an experience that stayed with us for a long time, and years later, my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C., and we started to ask the question, would it be possible, in the same way that The Gates responded to the physical layout of the park, to compose music for a landscape? \nWhich brought us to this. \n On Memorial Day, we released \"The National Mall,\" a location-aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device's built-in GPS functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of Washington, D.C. \nHundreds of musical segments are geo-tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape, a musical score is actually unfolding around them. \nSo this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park, but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener's chosen trajectory. \nSo think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album. \nLet's take a closer look. \nLet's look at one example here. \nSo using the app, as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the Washington Monument, you hear the sounds of instruments warming up, which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody. \nThis is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins. \nKeep walking, and a full choir joins in, until you finally reach the top of the hill and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness, as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park. \nBut were you to walk in the opposite direction, this entire sequence happens in reverse. \nAnd were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park, the music would fade to silence, and the play button would disappear. \nwho can't travel to the United States, but would like to hear this record. \nWell, unlike a normal album, we haven't been able to accommodate this request. \nWhen they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version, we just can't make that happen, and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. \nIn this case, the app is the work itself, and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience. \nSix months later, we did a location-aware album for Central Park, a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall, with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow to the Ramble to the Reservoir. \nCurrently, my brother and I are working on projects all over the country, but last spring we started a project, here actually at Stanford's Experimental Media Art Department, where we're creating our largest location-aware album to date, one that will span the entirety of Highway 1 here on the Pacific Coast. \nBut what we're doing, integrating GPS with music, is really just one idea. \nBut it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age, that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model, but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music. \nThank you. \n","predictions":" For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City, these shots might start to look familiar. \nThis is Central Park, one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in America. \nBut to anyone who hasn't visited, these images can't really fully convey. \nTo really understand Central Park, you have to physically be there. \nWell, the same is true of the music, which my brother and I composed and mapped  I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing -- That's us there.

Right? \nI mean, we all had those when we were little. \nAnd he wanted one so badly. \nBut then he started to realize something. \nIn the commercials, and on the boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. \nAnd the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple, very gender-specific colors to females, right? \nSo it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't. \nAnd this discouraged my brother a lot. \nHe thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef, because that was something that girls did. \nGirls cooked; boys didn't, or so was the message that Hasbro was sending. \nAnd this got me thinking, God, I wish there was a way that I could change this, that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it. \nAnd that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. \nChange.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. \nAnd so I created a petition along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. \nSo this petition started to take off -- humongously fast, you have no idea. \nI was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. \nIn three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. \n Thank you. \nSo, needless to say, it was crazy. \nEventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy-Bake Oven product to me in black, silver and blue. \nIt was literally one of the best moments of my life. \nIt was like &amp;quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.&amp;quot; That thing was amazing. \nWhat I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist, I could change something, that even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered, and your voice matters too. \nI want to let you know it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me, because I faced a lot of obstacles. \nPeople online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family, and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. \nAnd actually, I have some examples, because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? \nSo, let's see. \nFrom user name Liquidsore29 -- interesting user names we have here— &amp;quot;Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.&amp;quot; Liquidsore29, really?

{"src_passage":"This is a vending machine in Los Angeles. \nIt's in a shopping mall, and it sells fish eggs. \nIt's a caviar vending machine. \nThis is the Art-o-mat, an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists, usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes, in limited edition. \nThis is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine, but he is one of the founders of Genspace, a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York, where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. \nIn fact, I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago, and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now. \nBecause strawberry DNA is really fascinating, because it's so beautiful. \nI'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before, before I saw it in this form. \nAnd a lot of people, especially in the art community, don't necessarily engage in science in this way. \nI instantly joined Genspace after this, and I asked Oliver, \"Well, if we can do this strawberries, can we do this with people as well?\" \nAnd about 10 minutes later, we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction. \nAnd I started doing this on my own, and this is what my DNA actually looks like. \nAnd I was at a dinner party with some friends, some artist friends, and I was telling them about this project, and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA. \nSo I said, all right, let's get out some supplies right now. \nAnd I started having these bizarre dinner parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions, and I would actually capture them on video, because it created this kind of funny portrait as well. \n These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever. \nYou can kind of tell from their reactions. \nBut they became fascinated by it, and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science. \nAnd so I started doing this regularly. \nIt's kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights, but this is what I started doing, and I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials and categorizing them. \nThis is what that looked like. \nAnd it started to make me think about a couple of things. \nFirst of all, this looked a lot like my Facebook wall. \nSo in a way, I've created sort of a genetic network, a genetic social network, really. \nAnd the second thing was, one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like, \"Oh. \nWhy are they numbered? Is this person more rare than the other one?\" \nAnd I hadn't even thought about that. \nThey were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. \nBut that made me think about collecting toys, and this thing that's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys, and being able to collect these rare toys. \nYou buy these boxes. You're not sure what's going to be inside of them. \nBut then, when you open them up, you have different rarities of the toys. \nAnd so I thought that was interesting. \nI started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art-o-mat all together, and some reason, I was one night drawing a vending machine, thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine, and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there, the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine. \nAnd so, of course, I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine. \nHere it is. \n [\"DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology.\"] [\"For a reasonable cost, you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine.\"] [\"Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.\"] [\"DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.\"] Gabriel Garcia-Colombo: So the DNA Vending Machine \nis currently in a couple galleries in New York, and it's selling out pretty well, actually. \nWe're in the first edition of 100 pieces, hoping to do another edition pretty soon. \nI'd actually like to get it into more of a metro hub, like Grand Central or Penn Station, right next to some of the other, actual vending machines in that location. \nBut really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question, and that is, when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting or 3D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine, will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine? \nAnd how much will these samples be worth? \nAnd will you buy someone else's sample? \nAnd what will you be able to do with that sample? \nThank you. \n","predictions":"This is a vending machine in Los Angeles. \nIt's in a shopping mall, and it sells fish eggs. \nIt's a caviar vending machine. \nThis is the Art-o-mat, an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists, usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes, in limited edition. \nThis is Oliver Medvedik.

It rings. \nBut if you wait, that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don't notice it anymore. \nNow, that early universe was incredibly dense, like a metal, way denser, and if you hit it, it would ring, but the thing ringing would be the structure of space-time itself, and the hammer would be quantum mechanics. \nWhat they found on Monday was evidence of the ringing of the space-time of the early universe, what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era, and here's how they found it. \nThose waves have long since faded. \nIf you go for a walk, you don't wiggle. \nThose gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes. \nBut early on, when the universe was making that last afterglow, the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see. \nSo by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper -- in fact, these guys spent three years on the South Pole looking straight up through the coldest, clearest, cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol, the signal, the ringing of the early universe. \nAnd on Monday, they announced that they had found it. \nAnd the thing that's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing, though that is awesome. \nThe thing that's totally amazing, the reason I'm on this stage, is because what that tells us is something deep about the early universe. \nIt tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble -- and this is the idea of inflation— one large bubble surrounded by something else. \nThis isn't conclusive evidence for inflation, but anything that isn't inflation that explains this will look the same. \nThis is a theory, an idea, that has been around for a while, and we never thought we we'd really see it. \nFor good reasons, we thought we'd never see killer evidence, and this is killer evidence. \nBut the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff. \nWe're never going to see the stuff outside, but by going to the South Pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky, we can figure out that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that. \nAnd that amazes me. \nThanks a lot. \n","predictions":"If you look deep into the night sky, you see stars, and if you look further, you see more stars, and further, galaxies, and further, more galaxies. \nBut if you keep looking further and further, eventually you see nothing for a long while, and then finally you see a faint, fading afterglow, and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang. \nNow, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small, incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass, and from it sprung everything we see. \nNow, we've mapped that afterglow with great precision, and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me. \nWe've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision, and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform. \nFourteen billion light years that way and 14 billion light years that way, it's the same temperature. \nNow it's been 14 billion years since that Big Bang, and so it's got faint and cold. \nIt's now 2.7 degrees. \nBut it's not exactly 2.7 degrees. \nIt's only 2.7 degrees to about 10 parts in a million. \nOver here, it's a little hotter, and over there, it's a little cooler, and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room, because where it was a little hotter, there was a little more stuff, and where there was a little more stuff, we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. \nAnd those small, little, inhomogeneities, 20 parts in a million, those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos. \nThat is spectacular, and that's not what they found on Monday; what they found on Monday is cooler. \nSo here's what they found on Monday: Imagine you take a bell, and you whack the bell with a hammer. \nWhat happens?

{"src_passage":"So I've been thinking about the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues. \nThe résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé, which are the skills you bring to the marketplace. \nThe eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy, which are deeper: who are you, in your depth, what is the nature of your relationships, are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency? \nAnd most of us, including me, would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. \nBut at least in my case, are they the ones that I think about the most? And the answer is no. \nSo I've been thinking about that problem, and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi who wrote a book called \"The Lonely Man Of Faith\" in 1965. \nSoloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures, which he called Adam I and Adam II. \nAdam I is the worldly, ambitious, external side of our nature. \nHe wants to build, create, create companies, create innovation. \nAdam II is the humble side of our nature. \nAdam II wants not only to do good but to be good, to live in a way internally that honors God, creation and our possibilities. \nAdam I wants to conquer the world. \nAdam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world. \nAdam I savors accomplishment. \nAdam II savors inner consistency and strength. \nAdam I asks how things work. \nAdam II asks why we're here. \nAdam I's motto is \"success.\" \nAdam II's motto is \"love, redemption and return.\" \nAnd Soloveitchik argued that these two sides of our nature are at war with each other. \nWe live in perpetual self-confrontation between the external success and the internal value. \nAnd the tricky thing, I'd say, about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics. \nThe external logic is an economic logic: input leads to output, risk leads to reward. \nThe internal side of our nature is a moral logic and often an inverse logic. \nYou have to give to receive. \nYou have to surrender to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself. \nYou have to conquer the desire to get what you want. \nIn order to fulfill yourself, you have to forget yourself. \nIn order to find yourself, you have to lose yourself. \nWe happen to live in a society that favors Adam I, and often neglects Adam II. \nAnd the problem is, that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game, and you become a cold, calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there's a difference between your desired self and your actual self. \nYou're not earning the sort of eulogy you want, you hope someone will give to you. \nYou don't have the depth of conviction. \nYou don't have an emotional sonorousness. \nYou don't have commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit. \nI was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid Adam II, how you build a depth of character. \nThrough history, people have gone back into their own pasts, sometimes to a precious time in their life, to their childhood, and often, the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame, some sin committed, some act of selfishness, an act of omission, of shallowness, the sin of anger, the sin of self-pity, trying to be a people-pleaser, a lack of courage. \nAdam I is built by building on your strengths. \nAdam II is built by fighting your weaknesses. \nYou go into yourself, you find the sin which you've committed over and again through your life, your signature sin out of which the others emerge, and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin, and out of that wrestling, that suffering, then a depth of character is constructed. \nAnd we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves, in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it, how to confront it, and how to combat it. \nWe live in a culture with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate about Adam II. \nFinally, Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation, the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life, this way: \"Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. \nNothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. \nNothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love. \nNo virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint. \nTherefore we must be saved by that final form of love, which is forgiveness.” Thanks. \n","predictions":"So I've been thinking about the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues. \nThe résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé, which are the skills you bring to the marketplace. \nThe eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy, which are deeper: who are you, in your depth, what is the nature of your relationships, are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency? \nAnd most of us, including me, would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. \nBut at least in my case, are they the ones that I think about the most?

{"src_passage":"A computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression, but for the most part, that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones. \nAnd I'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live. \nA few years ago, I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York, and the next thing I knew, I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays. \nThis one's called \"The Chase.\" \nThere are two pairs of shoes, a man's pair and a woman's pair, and they play out this slow, tense chase in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space, and then she moves away. \nEach of the shoes has magnets in it, and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around. \nMy friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music. \nThe harp has four separate pendulums, and each pendulum has 11 strings, so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes, and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music. \nat the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen. \nAnd the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit, and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on. \nAnd she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit, and were helping people learn in a social way. \nAnd when you think about it, this makes a lot of sense, that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily. \nI mean, our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects. \nThink about which you find easier to use, a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone? \nBut the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch, down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software. \nI wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time. \nSo my first attempt at this was at the MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii, and we built this array of 512 different electromagnets, and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface. \nBut the problem with this was that these magnets cost over 10,000 dollars. \nAlthough each one was pretty small, altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag. \nSo I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction So to explore this idea, I built an army of small robots, and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels. \nThey're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions, and when you couple these robots with a video projector, you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information. \nSo here's an example of what I mean. \nThis is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical. \nSo if we want to tweak the color, we just enter the color mode, and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color, or if we want to adjust the audio, then we get two different dials for that, these physical objects. \nSo here the left and right channel stay in sync, but if we want to, we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time. \nSo the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that's designed in software. \nAnd this is a mapping application for disaster response. \nSo you have these physical objects that represent police, fire and rescue, and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go, and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world. \nThis is a video chat application. \nIt's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object. \nWith this interface, we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games, where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible. \nBut one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone. \nOne example of those is protein folding. \nSo here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein, and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways. \nAnd if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation, we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us. \nSo feeling what's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction. \nSo we're just beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment. \nMaybe this is the computer of the future. \nThere's no touchscreen. \nThere's no technology visible at all. \nBut when we want to have a video chat or

Let's wake him up. \nEDI, EDI. \nThese mechanical performers were popular throughout Europe. \nAudiences marveled at the way they moved. \nIt was science fiction made true, robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age, machines far in advance of anything that Victorian technology could create, a machine we would later know as the robot. \nEDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921 in a science fiction tale by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek. \nIt comes from \"robota.\" \nIt means \"forced labor.\" \nMarco Tempest: But these robots were not real. \nThey were not intelligent. \nThey were illusions, a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art. \nEDI is different. \nEDI is real. \nEDI: I am 176 centimeters tall. \nMT: He weighs 300 pounds. \nEDI: I have two seven-axis arms — MT: Core of sensing — EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system, and come complete with a warranty. \nMT: We love robots. \nEDI: Hi. I'm EDI.

{"src_passage":"Even nature's most disgusting creatures have important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them? \nYet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. \nRobust systems are stable in complex and new environments. \nRemarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. \nWhen we put a jet pack on them, or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. \nThey can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. \nWe discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass. \nRobust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. \nHere's a new behavior we've discovered. \nThe animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them — using the same structures that they use to run, their legs. \nThey can run upside down very rapidly on rods, branches and wires, and if you perturb one of those branches, they can do this. \nThey can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet. \nAnd they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas. \nThey have wings for flying when they get warm, but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized. \nVery effective. \nRobust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe. \nThis is the foot of a cockroach. \nIt has spines, gluey pads and claws, but if you take off those feet, they can still go over rough terrain, like the bottom video that you see, without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary. \nThey can run up mesh without their feet. \nHere's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod: three legs, three legs, three legs, but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs. \nHere's one moving with two middle legs gone. \nIt can even lose three legs, in a tripod, and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait. \nAnd I point out that all of these videos are slowed down 20 times, so they're actually really fast, when you see this. \nRobust systems are also damage resistant. \nHere's an animal climbing up a wall. \nIt looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb, but when you slow it down, you see something very different. \nHere's what they do. \nThey intentionally have a head-on collision with the wall so they don't slow down and can transition up it in 75 milliseconds. \nAnd they can do this in part because they have extraordinary exoskeletons. \nAnd they're really just made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another. \nHere's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach. \nYou see these plates, and you see the compliant membrane. \nMy engineering colleague at Berkeley designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton, you laser cut it, laminate it, and you fold it up into a robot. \nAnd you can do that now in less than 15 minutes. \nThese robots, called DASH, for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod, are highly compliant robots, and they're remarkably robust as a result of these features. \nThey're certainly incredibly damage resistant. \n They even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches. \nSo they can use their smart, compliant body to transition up a wall in a very simple way. \nThey even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear. \nNow we want to know why they can go anywhere. \nWe discovered that they can go through three-millimeter gaps, the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies, and when they do this, they can actually run through those confined spaces at high speeds, although you never see it. \nTo understand it better, we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over 40 percent. \nWe put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces 800 times their body weight, and after this they can fly and run absolutely normally. \nSo you never know where curiosity-based research will lead, and someday you may want a swarm of cockroach-inspired robots to come at you. \n Thank you. \n","predictions":"Even nature's most disgusting creatures have important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them? \nYet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. \nRobust systems are stable in complex and new environments. \nRemarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. \nWhen we put a jet pack on them, or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. \nThey can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. \nWe discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass. \nRobust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. \nHere's a new behavior we've discovered. \nThe animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them — using the same structures that they use to run, their legs. \nThey can run upside down very rapidly on rods, branches and wires, and if you perturb one of those branches, they can do this. \nThey can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet. \nAnd they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas. \nThey have wings for flying when they get warm, but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized. \nVery effective. \nRobust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe. \nThis is the foot of a cockroach. \nIt has spines, gluey pads and claws, but if you take off those feet, they can still go over rough terrain, like the bottom video that you see, without hardly slowing down.

{"src_passage":"Take a look at this drawing. \nCan you tell what it is? \nI'm a molecular biologist by training, and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings. \nThey're usually referred to as a model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs. \nThis particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis. \nIt's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell. \nThere's a problem with this drawing, though, and it's mainly in what it doesn't show. \nFrom lots of experiments, from lots of different scientists, we know a lot about what these molecules look like, how they move around in the cell, and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment. \nSo in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen, we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that. \nSo we start outside of the cell. \nNow we're looking inside. \nClathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes. \nThrough connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell. \nProteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle, making it separate from the rest of the membrane, and now clathrin is basically done with its job, and so proteins are coming in now — we've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage. \nAnd so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again. \nThese processes are too small to be seen directly, even with the best microscopes, so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis. \nHere's another illustration, and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells. \nAnd again, this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes. \nYou might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses. \nWhy? \nBecause creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard. \nI spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software, and I spend months on each animation, and that's just time that most researchers can't afford. \nThe payoffs can be huge, though. \nMolecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy. \nAnd I'm working on a new project now called \"The Science of HIV\" where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail. \nThe animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades, data on what this virus looks like, how it's able to infect cells in our body, and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection. \nOver the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis. \nBiologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study, and with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore. \nThe process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas. \nOne researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together, and in this way, animation can feed back into the research process. \nI believe that animation can change biology. \nIt can change the way that we communicate with one another, how we explore our data and how we teach our students. \nBut for that change to happen, we need more researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations. \nFrom our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation We're also building an online database where anyone can view, download and contribute their own animations. \nWe're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today. \nWe are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"Take a look at this drawing. \nCan you tell what it is?

How are you?\" \nAnd she looked at me, and I could tell that she recognized me, but she couldn't quite place me, and she looked at me and she said, \"Stephen Krosoczka?\" \nAnd I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka, but Stephen is my uncle who is 20 years older than I am, and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid. \nAnd she started telling me about her grandkids, and that blew my mind. \nMy lunch lady had grandkids, and therefore kids, and therefore left school at the end of the day? \nI thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons. \nI had never thought about any of that before. \nWell, that chance encounter inspired my imagination, and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series, a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes, a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes, and the end of every book, they get the bad guy with their hairnet, and they proclaim, \"Justice is served!\" \n  And it's been amazing, because the series was so welcomed into the reading lives of children, and they sent me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork. \nAnd I would notice as I would visit schools, the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way. \nAnd coast to coast, all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing: \"Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness.\" \nBecause the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time. \nBut it meant the most to Jeannie. \nWhen the books were first published, I invited her to the book launch party, and in front of everyone there, everyone she had fed over the years, I gave her a piece of artwork and some books. \nAnd two years after this photo was taken, she passed away, and I attended her wake, and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there, because next to her casket was this painting, and her husband told me it meant so much to her that I had acknowledged her hard work, I had validated what she did. \nAnd that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across the country: School Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids can make creative projects for their lunch staff. \nAnd I partnered with the School Nutrition Association, and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day. \nThat equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year. \nAnd the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray. \nThere is Ms. Brenda in California, who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss. \nThere are the lunch ladies in Kentucky who realized that 67 percent of their students relied on those meals every day, and they were going without food over the summer, so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit, and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings 500 kids a day during the summer. \nAnd kids made the most amazing projects. \nI knew they would. \nKids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper. \nThey took photos of their lunch lady's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers. \nAnd they made their own comics, starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies. \nAnd they made thank you pizzas, where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza. \nFor me, I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies, because one woman said to me, she said, \"Before this day, I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school. \nI didn't think that anyone noticed us down here.\" \nAnother woman said to me, \"You know, what I got out of this is that what I do is important.\" \nAnd of course what she does is important. \nWhat they all do is important. \nThey're feeding our children every single day, and before a child can learn, their belly needs to be full, and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society. \nSo I hope that you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day to say thank you to your lunch staff, and I hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be. \nA thank you can change a life. \nIt changes the life of the person who receives it, and it changes the life of the person who expresses it. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"When my first children's book was published in 2001, I returned to my old elementary school to talk to the students about being an author and an illustrator, and when I was setting up my slide projector I looked across the room, and there she was: my old lunch lady. \nShe was still there at the school and she was busily preparing lunches for the day. \nSo I approached her to say hello, and I said, \"Hi, Jeannie!

{"src_passage":"I would like to share with you today a project that has changed how I approach and practice architecture: the Fez River Rehabilitation Project. \nMy hometown of Fez, Morocco, boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world, called the medina, nestled in a river valley. \nThe entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \nSince the 1950s, as the population of the medina grew, basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed. \nOne of the biggest casualties of the situation was the Fez River, which bisects the medina in its middle and has been considered for many centuries as the city's very soul. \nIn fact, one can witness the presence of the river's extensive water network all throughout the city, in places such as private and public fountains. \nUnfortunately, because of the pollution of the river, it has been covered little by little by concrete slabs since 1952. \nThis process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina. \nThose urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards. \nActually, the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy. \nThen pollution takes its toll, mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning. \nAt some point, I couldn't bear the desecration of the river, such an important part of my city, and I decided to take action, especially after I heard that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it. \nWith clean water, suddenly the uncovering of the river became possible, and with luck and actually a lot of pushing, my partner Takako Tajima and I were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers to uncover the river. \nHowever, we were sneaky, and we proposed more: to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways, and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric, and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the Medina of Fez. \nI will show you briefly now two of these public spaces. \nThe first one is the Rcif Plaza, which sits actually right on top of the river, which you can see here in dotted lines. \nThis plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that actually compromised the urban integrity of the medina, that has the largest pedestrian network in the world. \nAnd right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here, right next to the plaza, you can see that the river looked like a river of trash. \nInstead, what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian, to cover it with recycled leather canopies, and to connect it to the banks of the river. \nThe second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks, and it used to be an illegal parking, and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina. \nThe playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods occur. \nAs the project progressed and received several design awards, new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals and design. The only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to do something very unusual that usually architects don't do. \nIt was for us to take our design ego and our sense of authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce all of the agendas of stakeholders and focus on the main goals of the project: that is, to uncover the river, treat its water, and provide public spaces for all. \nWe were actually very lucky, and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening. \nLike, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza. \nThis is how it looked like about six years ago.

We fret too much about minor hazards — improbable air crashes, carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, and so forth — but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. \nThe worst have thankfully not yet happened. \nIndeed, they probably won't. \nBut if an event is potentially devastating, it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it, even if it's unlikely, just as we take out fire insurance on our house. \nAnd as science offers greater power and promise, the downside gets scarier too. \nWe get ever more vulnerable. \nWithin a few decades, to misuse rapidly advancing biotech, just as they misuse cybertech today. \nFreeman Dyson, in a TED Talk, foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets. \nWell, this may be on the science fiction fringe, but were even part of his scenario to come about, our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed. \nFor instance, there are some eco-extremists who think that it would be better for the planet, What happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by 2050? \nAnd by then, other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality: dumb robots going rogue, or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all. \nWell, can we guard against such risks by regulation? \nWe must surely try, but these enterprises are so competitive, so globalized, and so driven by commercial pressure, that anything that can be done will be done somewhere, whatever the regulations say. \nIt's like the drug laws — we try to regulate, but can't. \nAnd the global village will have its village idiots, and they'll have a global range. \nSo as I said in my book, we'll have a bumpy ride through this century. \nThere may be setbacks to our society — indeed, a 50 percent chance of a severe setback. \nBut are there conceivable events that could be even worse, events that could snuff out all life? \nWhen a new particle accelerator came online, some people anxiously asked, could it destroy the Earth or, even worse, rip apart the fabric of space? \nWell luckily, reassurance could be offered. \nI and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times already, via cosmic ray collisions. \nBut scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world. \nBiologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens. \nAnd by the way, our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question, and it's this: Consider two scenarios. \nScenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity. \nScenario B wipes out 100 percent. \nHow much worse is B than A? \nSome would say 10 percent worse. \nThe body count is 10 percent higher. \nBut I claim that B is incomparably worse. \nAs an astronomer, I can't believe that humans are the end of the story. \nIt is five billion years before the sun flares up, and the universe may go on forever, so post-human evolution, here on Earth and far beyond, could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process that's led to us, and even more wonderful. \nAnd indeed, future evolution will happen much faster, on a technological timescale, not a natural selection timescale. \nSo we surely, in view of those immense stakes, shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential. \nSome scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction, but others may be disquietingly real. \nIt's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable, and in fact, that's why we at Cambridge University are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks. \nIt seems it's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters. \nAnd we need all the help we can get from others, because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos, a planet with 50 million centuries ahead of it. \nAnd so let's not jeopardize that future. \nAnd I'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called Peter Medawar. \nI quote, \"The bells that toll for mankind are like the bells of Alpine cattle. \nThey are attached to our own necks, and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound.\" \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"Ten years ago, I wrote a book which I entitled \"Our Final Century?\" Question mark. \nMy publishers cut out the question mark.

{"src_passage":"So recently, some white guys and some black women swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online. \nThey didn't change their content, they kept tweeting the same as usual, but suddenly, the white guys noticed they were getting called the n-word all the time and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse, whereas the black women all of a sudden noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them. \nNow, if you're my five-year-old, your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies. \nThat's a thing. Google it. \nBut the rest of us know that the Internet can be a really ugly place. \nI'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our democracy. \nI'm talking about nasty personal attacks. \nMaybe it's happened to you, but it's at least twice as likely to happen, and be worse, if you're a woman, a person of color, or gay, or more than one at the same time. \nIn fact, just as I was writing this talk, I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks. \nThe bio says that I'm a \"man-hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality.\" \nWhich, incidentally, is only a third correct. \nI mean, lies!  But seriously, we all say we hate this crap. \nThe question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it. \nI don't mean giving up the Internet. \nI mean changing the way you click, because clicking is a public act. \nIt's no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers. \nIncreasingly, we're all the media. \nI used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up, I put on a lot of makeup, I go on television, I talk about the news. \nThat is a public act of making media. \nAnd then I go home and I browse the web and I'm reading Twitter, and that's a private act of consuming media. \nI mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. \nWrong. \nEverything we blog, everything we Tweet, and everything we click is a public act of making media. \nWe are the new editors. \nWe decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to. \nThat's how the media works now. \nThere's all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on, and that in turn shapes our whole culture. \nOver three out of five Americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now, but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five Americans are clicking on the same insult-oriented, rumor-mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society. \nIn an increasingly noisy media landscape, the incentive is to make more noise to be heard, and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty. \nIt does not have to be that way. \nIt does not. \nWe can change the incentive. \nFor starters, there are two things we can all do. \nFirst, don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt. \nIf someone is being abused online, do something. \nBe a hero. This is your chance. \nSpeak up. Speak out.

Google it. \nBut the rest of us know that the Internet can be a really ugly place. \nI'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our democracy. \nI'm talking about nasty personal attacks. \nMaybe it's happened to you, but it's at least twice as likely to happen, and be worse, if you're a woman, a person of color, or gay, or more than one at the same time. \nIn fact, just as I was writing this talk, I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks. \nThe bio says that I'm a \"man-hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality.\" \nWhich, incidentally, is only a third correct. \nI mean, lies!  But seriously, we all say we hate this crap. \nThe question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it. \nI don't mean giving up the Internet. \nI mean changing the way you click, because clicking is a public act. \nIt's no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers. \nIncreasingly, we're all the media. \nI used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up, I put on a lot of makeup, I go on television, I talk about the news. \nThat is a public act of making media. \nAnd then I go home and I browse the web and I'm reading Twitter, and that's a private act of consuming media. \nI mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. \nWrong. \nEverything we blog, everything we Tweet, and everything we click is a public act of making media. \nWe are the new editors. \nWe decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to. \nThat's how the media works now. \nThere's all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on, and that in turn shapes our whole culture. \nOver three out of five Americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now, but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five Americans are clicking on the same insult-oriented, rumor-mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society. \nIn an increasingly noisy media landscape, the incentive is to make more noise to be heard, and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty. \nIt does not have to be that way. \nIt does not. \nWe can change the incentive. \nFor starters, there are two things we can all do. \nFirst, don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt. \nIf someone is being abused online, do something. \nBe a hero.

It's such a unique perspective. \nNothing really communicates this scale, for example, in context, in a way that this does. \nBut there are a few hurdles, and they are quite basic and quite fundamental. \nOne is piloting. \nSo for this image, they flew a camera, a five kilogram device with an SLR under it. \nIt's quite heavy, lots of spinning, sharp things. \nIt's a bit uncomfortable to fly, probably also for the operator. \nIn fact, you can see that on the back of the pilot's shirt, it says, \"No questions until landing\" in Russian and in English, because people are curious, and they'll go tap you, and then you lose your focus and things happen. \nAnd these guys are great. They're professionals; they're really careful in what they do. \nSo in the protests, maybe you noticed, they flew over the river so it was quite safe. \nBut this doesn't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions, so we really have to make piloting easier. \nThe other problem is regulations, or rather, the lack of good regulation. \nFor many good reasons, it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras. \nSo we already have cameras. \nEveryone here, I'm sure, has a smartphone with a camera, right? \nThere are more and more of them. \nYou hear about people with Google Glass being attacked. \nYou hear about, actually, a drone pilot, a hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach. \nHere's some personal input I didn't expect. \nJust yesterday, I was attacked by a guy who claimed that I was filming him. \nI was checking my email right here — easy way to get input for your talk. \nBut I think there are better solutions. \nI think we have to defuse the situation. \nWe have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety, accountability issues but still give us that perspective. \nAnd this is one potential solution. \nSo this is the Fotokite. \nWell, let me see, it's a quadrocopter, but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash. \nIt's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient. \nAnd the neat thing about it is, to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this. \nYou just turn it on and you point in the direction that you want to fly. \nYou give it a little twist. \nThat's kind of the way you communicate. \nAnd there it goes. \n So the interaction is super simple. \nIt's like a personal flying pet. \nIt just always maintains a certain angle to you, and if I move around with it, it'll actually follow me naturally. \nAnd of course, we can build on top of this. \nSo this leash has some additional electronics. \nYou can turn it on. \nAnd now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower, if you have such a dog. So, I can press a button and manipulate it rather easily. \nSo I just shifted its position. \nAnd it's really safe. \nI don't know about you guys in the front row —  — but at least in principle, you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection. \nLive demos are hard, right? \nThings go wrong all the time. \nBut no matter what, this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you. \nWhat's more, it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device. \nYou don't have to look for someone controlling it. \nNow, I can tell you that it's easy a lot, but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it. \nAnd if I can do this on stage live, then I can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to operate one of these devices. \nSo now we have two eyes in the sky.  And now the trick is getting them back. \n So my question now to you is, well, it's a nice solution, it's very accessible, it's safe. \nWhat would you use it for? \nWhat would you use such a camera for in your life? \nThank you. \n","predictions":"I came here to show you the Fotokite. \nIt's a tethered, flying camera. \nBut before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about where it came from, what motivated it. \nSo I was born in Russia, and three years ago, in 2011, there were the Russian federal elections. \nThere were massive irregularities reported, and people came out to protest, which was very unlikely for Russia. \nAnd no one really knew how significant these protests were, because, for whatever reason, the world media largely ignored it. \nNow, there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby — usually photographing things like the Sphinx, the Pyramids — who happened to be right around the corner, and they flew a camera and they took some snapshots, some panoramas of this demonstration. \nJust completely independent entity, completely random occurrence, and the image, when I saw it, it really struck me. \nHere's one of the panoramas. \nSo in a single image, you can really see the scale of this event — just the number of people, the colors, the banners. \nYou just can't consider this insignificant. \nAll in a single image, which was really cool to me. \nAnd I think, in the future, journalism and many other professions, there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there, but I think, you wait a few months, a few years, and for many professions, it's really going to be a requirement. \nAnd it make sense.

So, I can press a button and manipulate it rather easily. \nSo I just shifted its position. \nAnd it's really safe. \nI don't know about you guys in the front row —  — but at least in principle, you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection. \nLive demos are hard, right? \nThings go wrong all the time. \nBut no matter what, this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you. \nWhat's more, it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device. \nYou don't have to look for someone controlling it. \nNow, I can tell you that it's easy a lot, but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it. \nAnd if I can do this on stage live, then I can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to operate one of these devices. \nSo now we have two eyes in the sky.  And now the trick is getting them back. \n So my question now to you is, well, it's a nice solution, it's very accessible, it's safe. \nWhat would you use it for? \nWhat would you use such a camera for in your life? \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":1400,"num_sentence":73}
{"src_passage":"I want you guys to imagine that you're a soldier running through the battlefield. \nNow, you're shot in the leg with a bullet, which severs your femoral artery. \nNow, this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less than three minutes. \nUnfortunately, by the time that a medic actually gets to you, what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more, with the application of pressure, to stop that type of bleed. \nNow, this problem is not only a huge problem for the military, but it's also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field, which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body? \nSo now, what I've been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials, which are actually materials that will work with the body, helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally. \nSo now, before we do this, we have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work. \nSo now, everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells. \nSo the cell is the most basic unit of life. \nBut not many people know what else. \nBut it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers, proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix. \nSo now, the ECM is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place, provides structure for your tissues, but it also gives the cells a home. \nIt allows them to feel what they're doing, where they are, and tells them how to act and how to behave. \nAnd it actually turns out that the extracellular matrix is different from every single part of the body. \nSo the ECM in my skin is different than the ECM in my liver, and the ECM in different parts of the same organ actually vary, so it's very difficult to be able to have a product that will react to the local extracellular matrix, which is exactly what we're trying to do. \nSo now, for example, think of the rainforest. \nYou have the canopy, you have the understory, and you have the forest floor. \nNow, all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants, and different animals call them home. \nSo just like that, the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions. \nOn top of that, the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing, so if you imagine cutting the body, you actually have to rebuild this very complex ECM in order to get it to form again, and a scar, in fact, is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix. \nSo now, behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix. \nSo as you see, your cells sit in this complicated mesh and as you move throughout the tissue, the extracellular matrix changes. \nSo now every other piece of technology on the market can only manage a two- dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix, which means that it doesn't fit in with the tissue itself. \nSo when I was a freshman at NYU, what I discovered was you could actually take small pieces of plant-derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound. \nSo if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me, you can actually put our material onto this, and just like Lego blocks, it'll reassemble into the local tissue. \nSo that means if you put it onto liver, it turns into something that looks like liver, and if you put it onto skin, it turns into something that looks just like skin. \nSo when you put the gel on, it actually reassembles into this local tissue. \nSo now, this has a whole bunch of applications, but basically the idea is, wherever you put this product, you're able to reassemble into it immediately. \nNow, this is a simulated arterial bleed — blood warning — at twice human artery pressure. \nSo now, this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic, and like I said before, would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop. \nNow, in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself, our material is able to stop that bleed, and it's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal, so it reassembles into this piece of meat, and then the blood actually recognizes that that's happening, and produces fibrin, producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds. \nSo now this technology — Thank you. \n So now this technology, by January, will be in the hands of veterinarians, and we're working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of doctors, hopefully within the next year. \nBut really, once again, I want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier running through a battlefield. \nNow, you get hit in the leg with a bullet, and instead of bleeding out in three minutes, you pull a small pack of gel out of your belt, and with the press of a button, you're able to stop your own bleed and you're on your way to recovery. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"I want you guys to imagine that you're a soldier running through the battlefield. \nNow, you're shot in the leg with a bullet, which severs your femoral artery. \nNow, this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less than three minutes. \nUnfortunately, by the time that a medic actually gets to you, what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more, with the application of pressure, to stop that type of bleed. \nNow, this problem is not only a huge problem for the military, but it's also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field, which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body?

\nIt was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction. \nSo in the early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign. \nWhales in our waters are still low in numbers, however, because they do face a range of other human-induced threats. \nUnfortunately, many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful. \nThis is actually a disservice, because whales are ecosystem engineers. \nThey help maintain the stability and health of the oceans, and even provide services to human society. \nSo let's talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans. \nIt boils down to two main things: whale poop and rotting carcasses. \nAs whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe, they actually release these enormous fecal plumes. \nThis whale pump, as it's called, actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, which forms the base of all marine food chains. \nSo really, having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem. \nWhales are also known to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals. \nGray whales off America migrate 16,000 kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving, or birthing, areas and back every year. \nAs they do so, they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it. \nSo clearly, whales are really important in nutrient cycling, both horizontally and vertically, through the oceans. \nBut what's really cool is that they're also really important after they're dead. \nWhale carcasses are some of the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean's surface, and they're called whale fall. \nAs these carcasses sink, they provide a feast to some 400-odd species, So over the 200 years of whaling, when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans, we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans, and as a result, probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival. \nWhale carcasses are also known to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon, which is the equivalent of that produced by 80,000 cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep oceans, and the deep oceans are what we call \"carbon sinks,\" because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere, and therefore help to delay global warming. \nSometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land. \nThe 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between 60 to 90 percent. \nClearly, the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on, but we need to revise this. \nWe need to address the more modern, pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today. \nAmongst other things, we need to stop them from getting plowed down by container ships when they're in their feeding areas, and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean. \nWe also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages, so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures. \nSo, let's save the whales again, but this time, let's not just do it for their sake. \nLet's also do it for ours. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"In the 1600s, there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay off the east coast of the U.S. \nthat apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other. \nToday, they number in the hundreds, and they're endangered. \nLike them, many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by 200 years of whaling, where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat, oil and whale bone. \nWe only have whales in our waters today because of the Save the Whales movement of the '70s. \nIt was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling, and was built on the idea that if we couldn't save whales, what could we save?

{"src_passage":"I have a confession to make. \nAs a scientist and engineer, I've focused on efficiency for many years. \nBut efficiency can be a cult, and today I'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality. \nA few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. in London, I moved to Boston. \nI lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge. \nI bought a racing bicycle that summer, and I bicycled every day to work. \nTo find my way, I used my phone. \nIt sent me over Mass. Ave., Massachusetts Avenue, the shortest route from Boston to Cambridge. \nBut after a month that I was cycling every day on the car-packed Mass. Ave., I took a different route one day. \nI'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day, a detour. \nI just remember a feeling of surprise; surprise at finding a street with no cars, as opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars; surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees. \nBut after the feeling of surprise, I felt shame. \nHow could I have been so blind? \nFor an entire month, I was so trapped in my mobile app that a journey to work became one thing only: the shortest path. \nIn this single journey, there was no thought of enjoying the road, no pleasure in connecting with nature, no possibility of looking people in the eyes. \nAnd why? \nBecause I was saving a minute out of my commute. \nNow let me ask you: Am I alone here? \nHow many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions? \nMost of you, if not all, have. \nAnd don't get me wrong -- mapping apps are the greatest game-changer for encouraging people to explore the city. \nYou take your phone out and you know immediately where to go. \nHowever, the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination. \nIt has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination. \nAfter that experience, I changed. \nI changed my research from traditional data-mining to understanding how people experience the city. \nI used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale, at web scale. \nI became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by Jane Jacobs, Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch. \nThe result of that research has been the creation of new maps, maps where you don't only find the shortest path, the blue one, but also the most enjoyable path, the red one. \nHow was that possible? \nEinstein once said, \"Logic will get you from A to B. \nImagination will take you everywhere.\" \nSo with a bit of imagination, we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful. \nAt the University of Cambridge, with colleagues, we thought about this simple experiment. \nIf I were to show you these two urban scenes, and I were to ask you which one is more beautiful, which one would you say? \nDon't be shy. \nWho says A? Who says B? \nBrilliant. \nBased on that idea, we built a crowdsourcing platform, a web game. \nPlayers are shown pairs of urban scenes, and they're asked to choose which one is more beautiful, quiet and happy. \nBased on thousands of user votes, then we are able to see where consensus emerges. \nWe are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy. \nAfter that work, I joined Yahoo Labs, and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano, and together, we aggregated those winning locations in London to build a new map of the city, a cartography weighted for human emotions. \nOn this cartography, you're not only able to see and connect from point A to point B the shortest segments, but you're also able to see the happy segment, the beautiful path, the quiet path. \nIn tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one, and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time. \nParticipants also love to attach memories to places. \nShared memories -- that's where the old BBC building was; and personal memories -- that's where I gave my first kiss. \nThey also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded. \nSo what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell, sound, and memories? \nThat's where our research is going right now. \nMore generally, my research, what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path, to avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live. \nWalk the path through the park, not through the car park, and you have an entirely different path. \nWalk the path full of people you love and not full of cars, and you have an entirely different path. \nIt's that simple. \nI would like to end with this thought: do you remember \"The Truman Show?\" \nIt's a media satire in which a real person doesn't know he's living in a fabricated world. \nPerhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency. \nLook at some of your daily habits, and as Truman did in the movie, escape the fabricated world. \nWhy? \nWell, if you think that adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"I have a confession to make. \nAs a scientist and engineer, I've focused on efficiency for many years. \nBut efficiency can be a cult, and today I'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality. \nA few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. in London, I moved to Boston. \nI lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge. \nI bought a racing bicycle that summer, and I bicycled every day to work. \nTo find my way, I used my phone. \nIt sent me over Mass.

Who says B? \nBrilliant. \nBased on that idea, we built a crowdsourcing platform, a web game. \nPlayers are shown pairs of urban scenes, and they're asked to choose which one is more beautiful, quiet and happy. \nBased on thousands of user votes, then we are able to see where consensus emerges. \nWe are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy. \nAfter that work, I joined Yahoo Labs, and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano, and together, we aggregated those winning locations in London to build a new map of the city, a cartography weighted for human emotions. \nOn this cartography, you're not only able to see and connect from point A to point B the shortest segments, but you're also able to see the happy segment, the beautiful path, the quiet path. \nIn tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one, and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time. \nParticipants also love to attach memories to places. \nShared memories -- that's where the old BBC building was; and personal memories -- that's where I gave my first kiss. \nThey also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded. \nSo what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell, sound, and memories? \nThat's where our research is going right now. \nMore generally, my research, what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path, to avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live. \nWalk the path through the park, not through the car park, and you have an entirely different path. \nWalk the path full of people you love and not full of cars, and you have an entirely different path. \nIt's that simple. \nI would like to end with this thought: do you remember \"The Truman Show?\" \nIt's a media satire in which a real person doesn't know he's living in a fabricated world. \nPerhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency. \nLook at some of your daily habits, and as Truman did in the movie, escape the fabricated world. \nWhy? \nWell, if you think that adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly. \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":1304,"num_sentence":65}

Right? \nYou can check out books from home, you can research on the way to school or from school, but these are really two big assumptions, that one, you have access at home, and two, that you have access to a mobile phone, and in Philadelphia, many kids do not. \nSo what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud-based library, what used to be considered such a basic part of education? \nHow do they stay competitive? \nA final example from across the world in East Africa: there's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights, for a number of reasons. \nMigrant communities, older generations dying off, and ultimately poor record-keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what. \nAnd so there was a big movement to put all this information online, to track all the ownership of these plots of land, put them in the cloud, and give them to the communities. \nBut actually, the unintended consequence of this has been that venture capitalists, investors, real estate developers, have swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under these communities, because they have access to the technologies and the connectivity that makes that possible. \nSo that's the common thread that connects these examples, the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make. \nAs engineers, as technologists, we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy. \nWe think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing. \nThis needs to change. \nWe have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build, especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live. \nIn the late '90s, there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking. \nI think in 2014, we're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech and technology. \nSo, I just encourage you, as you are all thinking about the next big thing, as entrepreneurs, as CEOs, as engineers, as makers, that you think about the unintended consequences because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"As a software developer and technologist, I've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years. \nCivic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good, using technology to solve humanitarian problems. \nThis is in 2010 in Uganda, working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent. \nThat same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control. \nBut over the years, as I have thought about these technologies and the things that I work on, a question kind of nags in the back of my mind, which is, what if we're wrong about the virtues of technology, and if it sometimes actively hurts the communities that we're intending to help? \nThe tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that if we build great things, it will positively affect everyone. \nEventually, these innovations will get out and find everyone. \nBut that's not always the case. \nI like to call this blind championing of technology \"trickle-down techonomics,\" to borrow a phrase.

{"src_passage":"Hello. \nI'm a toy developer. \nWith a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before, I began working at a toy company nine years ago. \nWhen I first started working there, I proposed many new ideas to my boss every day. \nHowever, my boss always asked if I had the data to prove it would sell, and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data. \nData, data, data. \nSo I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product. \nHowever, I was unable to think of anything new at that moment. \n My ideas were unoriginal. I wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking. \nIt was so hard that I became this skinny. \n It's true.  You've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too. \nYour boss was being difficult. The data was difficult. You become sick of thinking. \nNow, I throw out the data. \nIt's my dream to create new toys. \nAnd now, instead of data, I'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas. \nI would like to introduce this method today. \nWhat is Shiritori? \nTake apple, elephant and trumpet, for example. \nIt's a game where you take turns saying words that start with the last letter of the previous word. \nIt's the same in Japanese and English. \nYou can play Shiritori as you like: \"neko, kora, raibu, burashi,\" etc, etc. [Cat, cola, concert, brush] Many random words will come out. \nYou force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas. \nIn my case, for example, since I want to think of toys, what could a toy cat be? \nA cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place? \nHow about a toy with cola? \nA toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet? \n Ridiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing. \nThe more ideas you produce, you're sure to come up with some good ones, too. \nA brush, for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy? \nWe could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and --  -- you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth. \n  Kids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it. \nCan we make a hat into a toy? \nHow about something like a roulette game, where you try the hat on one by one, and then, when someone puts it on, a scary alien breaks through the top screaming, \"Ahh!\" \nI wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties? \nIdeas that didn't come out while you stare at the data will start to come out. \nActually, this bubble wrap, which is used to pack fragile objects, combined with a toy, made Mugen Pop Pop, a toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like. \nIt was a big hit when it reached stores. \nData had nothing to do with its success. \nAlthough it's only popping bubbles, it's a great way to kill time, so please pass this around amongst yourselves today and play with it. \n Anyway, you continue to come up with useless ideas. \nThink up many trivial ideas, everyone. \nIf you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you're aiming for, you'll end up trying too hard, and you can't produce new ideas. \nEven if you know what your aim is, think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed. \nIf you do this, you surely will hit somewhere near the center. \nAt least one will. \nThat's the one you should choose. \nIf you do so, that idea will be in demand and, moreover, it will be brand new. \nThat is how I think of new ideas. \nIt doesn't have to be Shiritori; there are many different methods. \nYou just have to choose words at random. \nYou can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random. \nFor example, you could look up two random letters and gather the results or go to the store and connect product names with what you want to think of. \nThe point is to gather random words, not information from the category you're thinking for. \nIf you do this, the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected and form connections that will produce many ideas. \nThe greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images. \nBecause you're thinking of one word after another, the image of the previous word is still with you. \nThat image will automatically be related with future words. \nUnconsciously, a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat. \nYou wouldn't even realize it. You can come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. \nThis method is, of course, not just for toys. \nYou can collect ideas for books, apps, events, and many other projects. \nI hope you all try this method. \nThere are futures that are born from data. \nHowever, using this silly game called Shiritori, I look forward to the exciting future you will create, a future you couldn't even imagine. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"Hello. \nI'm a toy developer. \nWith a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before, I began working at a toy company nine years ago. \nWhen I first started working there, I proposed many new ideas to my boss every day. \nHowever, my boss always asked if I had the data to prove it would sell, and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data. \nData, data, data. \nSo I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product. \nHowever, I was unable to think of anything new at that moment. \n My ideas were unoriginal.

{"src_passage":"These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures. \nThey're bizzarre, they're beautiful, and there's very little we know about them. \nwhen I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book. \nI was about five years old at the time, and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist. \nPaleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world. \nAnd now, a few years later, I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet, the Sahara. \nI've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus. \nA few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist. \nUnfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II. \nSo all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes. \nFrom these drawings, we know that this creature, which lived about 100 million years ago, was very big, it had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail, and it had long, slender jaws, a bit like a crocodile, with conical teeth, that may have been used to catch slippery prey, like fish. \nBut that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years. \nMy fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria, a place called the Kem Kem. \nIt's a difficult place to work in. \nYou have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions, and it's very difficult to find good fossils there. \nBut our hard work paid off. \nWe discovered many incredible specimens. \nThere's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara. \nWe found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs, medium-sized predatory dinosaurs, and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters. \nThese fossils were deposited in a river system. \nThe river system was also home to a giant, car-sized coelacanth, a monster sawfish, and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs, flying reptiles. \nIt was a pretty dangerous place, not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine. \nSo we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus, but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive. \nWe were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point. \nFinally, very recently, we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus. \nWe returned to the site, we collected more bones. \nAnd so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature. \nAnd we were able to reconstruct it. \nWe now know that Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile, very different from other predatory dinosaurs, very different from the T. rex. \nBut the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton. \nWe had long spines, the spines forming the big sail. \nWe had leg bones, we had skull bones, we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet -- again, very unusual, no other dinosaur has feet like this -- and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment, or maybe for paddling in the water. \nWe also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones, and it turns out that they're very dense and compact. \nAgain, this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water, it's useful for buoyancy control in the water. \nWe C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton. \nAnd when we looked at the digital skeleton, we realized that yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other. \nIt's bigger than a T. rex, and yes, the head has \"fish-eating\" written all over it, but really the entire skeleton has \"water-loving\" written all over it -- dense bone, paddle-like feet, and the hind limbs are reduced in size, and again, this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water. \nSo, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus -- I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin -- we realize that we're dealing with a river monster, a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex, the ruler of this ancient river of giants, feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on. \nSo that's really what makes this an incredible discovery. \nIt's a dinosaur like no other. \nAnd some people told me, \"Wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. \nThere are not many things left to discover in the world.\" \nWell, I think nothing could be further from the truth. \nI think the Sahara's still full of treasures, and when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews, and he said, \"Always, there has been an adventure just around the corner -- and the world is still full of corners.\" \nThat was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines. \nAnd it is still true today. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"These

hard work paid off. \nWe discovered many incredible specimens. \nThere's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara. \nWe found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs, medium-sized predatory dinosaurs, and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters. \nThese fossils were deposited in a river system. \nThe river system was also home to a giant, car-sized coelacanth, a monster sawfish, and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs, flying reptiles. \nIt was a pretty dangerous place, not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine. \nSo we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus, but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive. \nWe were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point. \nFinally, very recently, we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus. \nWe returned to the site, we collected more bones. \nAnd so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature. \nAnd we were able to reconstruct it. \nWe now know that Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile, very different from other predatory dinosaurs, very different from the T. rex. \nBut the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton. \nWe had long spines, the spines forming the big sail. \nWe had leg bones, we had skull bones, we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet -- again, very unusual, no other dinosaur has feet like this -- and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment, or maybe for paddling in the water. \nWe also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones, and it turns out that they're very dense and compact. \nAgain, this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water, it's useful for buoyancy control in the water. \nWe C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton. \nAnd when we looked at the digital skeleton, we realized that yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other. \nIt's bigger than a T. rex, and yes, the head has \"fish-eating\" written all over it, but really the entire skeleton has \"water-loving\" written all over it -- dense bone, paddle-like feet, and the hind limbs are reduced in size, and again, this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water. \nSo, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus -- I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin -- we realize that we're dealing with a river monster, a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex, the ruler of this ancient river of giants, feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on. \nSo that's really what makes this an incredible discovery. \nIt's a dinosaur like no other. \nAnd some people told me, \"Wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. \nThere are not many things left to discover in the world.\" \nWell, I think nothing could be further from the truth. \nI think the Sahara's still full of treasures, and when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews, and he said, \"Always, there has been an adventure just around the corner -- and the world is still full of corners.\" \nThat was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines. \nAnd it is still true today. \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":1394,"num_sentence":47}

{"src_passage":"In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia, I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. \nAt the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94. \nAnd for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey. \nWhen I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do, he was like, \"Thank God you finally came,\" and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. \nThe most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything -- neither a sketch, or what I was going to write. \nIn every work that I create, I write messages with my style of calligraffiti -- a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. \nI use quotes or poetry. \nFor the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran, so I picked this verse: \"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other.\" \nIt was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media. \nI was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting, and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. \nFor the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. \nHe hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city, and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. \nThe universality of the message, the political context of Tunisia at this time, and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. \nIt reunited the community. \nBringing people, future generations, together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. \nWriting messages is the essence of my artwork. \nWhat is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. \nYou don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. \nI think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. \nThere is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. \nArabic script speaks to anyone, I believe; to you, to you, to you, to anybody, and then when you get the meaning, you feel connected to it. \nI always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting, but messages that have a universal dimension, so anybody around the world can connect to it. \nI was born and raised in France, in Paris, and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18. \nToday I only write messages in Arabic. \nOne of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world. \nIn Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa, who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela, and then I painted it on the rooftop. \nThe local community were really intrigued by what I was doing, but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, they thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece. \nIn South Africa, in Cape Town, the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. \nIt was a school, and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela, saying, \"[in Arabic],\" which means, \"It seems impossible until it's done.\" \nThen this guy came to me and said, \"Man, why you don't write in English?\" \nand I replied to him, \"I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu.\" \nIn Paris, once, there was this event, and someone gave his wall to be painted. \nAnd when he saw I was painting in Arabic, he got so mad -- actually, hysterical -- and he asked for the wall to be erased. \nI was mad and disappointed. \nBut a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back, and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. \nSo, this guy --  like, was forced to see it every day. \nAt the beginning, I was going to write, \"[In Arabic],\" which means, \"In your face,\" but --  I decided to be smarter and I wrote, \"[In Arabic],\" which means, \"Open your heart.\" \nI'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. \nAnd I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know, with the beauty of Arabic script. \nToday, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. \nI don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken, as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning, as you can enjoy any music from other countries. \nSome people see that as a rejection or a closed door, but for me, it's more an invitation -- to my language, to my culture, and to my art. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia, I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. \nAt the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94. \nAnd for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey. \nWhen I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do, he was like, \"Thank God you finally came,\" and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. \nThe most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything -- neither a sketch, or what I was going to write. \nIn every work that I create, I write messages with my style of calligraffiti -- a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. \nI use quotes or poetry. \nFor the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran, so I picked this verse: \"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other.\" \nIt was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media. \nI was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting, and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. \nFor the imam, it was not just the painting;

{"src_passage":"I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver. \nThere is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light. \nAnd you may wonder, what's the point? \nAnd the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call \"The Internet of Things\" -- tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet. \nIn my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy-neutral. This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible. \nAnd this is where the solar cell and the LED come in. \nI demonstrated for the first time, at TED in 2011, Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity. \nLi-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast, and also in a safe and secure manner. \nData is transported by the light, encoded in subtle changes of the brightness. \nIf we look around, we have many LEDs around us, so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us. \nBut so far, we have been using special devices -- small photo detectors, to receive the information encoded in the data. \nI wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li-Fi lights. \nAnd this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels. \nA solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy. \nThis is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone. \nBut now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED, so if the incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the solar cell. \nThis means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light and by the solar cell, because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted. \nOf course the question is: can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness, such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights? \nAnd the answer to that is yes, we can. \nWe have shown in the lab that we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell. \nAnd this is faster than most broadband connections these days. \nNow let me show you in practice. \nIn this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp. \nThis is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell; it is connected to the laptop. \nAnd also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell. \nAnd this instrument shows something at the moment. \nThis is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light. \nNow what I would like to do first is switch on the light, and I'll simply, only switch on the light, for a moment, and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right. \nSo the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source. \nIf I turn it off, we see it drops. \nI turn it on ... \nSo we harvest energy with the solar cell. \nBut next I would like to activate the streaming of the video. \nAnd I've done this by pressing this button. \nSo now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way, and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye, because the changes are too fast to recognize. \nBut in order to prove the point, I can block the light of the solar cell. \nSo first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. \nIf I remove the blockage, the video will restart. \n And I can repeat that. \nSo we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well. \nSo that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver. \nBut now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog. \nAnd so I want to simulate fog, and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me. \n And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell. \nFirst you notice the energy harvested drops, as expected, but now the video still continues. \nThis means, despite the blockage, there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition video. \nWhat's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device. \nThat's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post. \nAnd It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell. \nAnd the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows, solar cells integrated into street furniture, or indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the Internet of Things. \nBecause simply, we don't want to charge these devices regularly, or worse, replace the batteries every few months. \nAs I said to you, this is the first time I've shown this in public. \nIt's very much a lab demonstration, a prototype. \nBut my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. \nAnd we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide, and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet. \nAnd all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption -- because of the solar cells, quite the opposite. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver. \nThere is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light. \nAnd you may wonder, what's the point?

{"src_passage":"I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. \nI can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. \nBut I know that it's there. \nAnd understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. \nOn our planet, where there's water, there's life. \nSo we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. \nAt this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. \nSome astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. \nWhat I do picks up where their job ends. \nI model the possible climates of exoplanets. \nAnd here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star Take the planet Venus. \nIt's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky. \nBut spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. \nThe surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius. \nThat's hot enough to melt lead. \nIts thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. \nIt causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. \nThe reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. \nFrom these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. \nWe don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. \nFor example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away. \nSo that's more than 100 trillion miles. \nof an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. \nIt's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. \nOK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away,

in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. \nI can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. \nBut I know that it's there. \nAnd understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. \nOn our planet, where there's water, there's life. \nSo we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. \nAt this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. \nSome astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. \nWhat I do picks up where their job ends. \nI model the possible climates of exoplanets. \nAnd here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star Take the planet Venus. \nIt's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky. \nBut spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. \nThe surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius. \nThat's hot enough to melt lead. \nIts thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. \nIt causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. \nThe reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. \nFrom these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. \nWe don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. \nFor example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away. \nSo that's more than 100 trillion miles. \nof an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. \nIt's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. \nOK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly. \nSo I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life. \nHere's an artist's concept of

{"src_passage":"Have you ever been asked by your Chinese friend, \"What is your zodiac sign?\" \nDon't think they are making small talk. \nIf you say, \"I'm a Monkey,\" they immediately know you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old. \n Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age. \nBy revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated. \nJudgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune, your personality, career prospects and how you will do in a given year. \nIf you share you and your partner's animal signs, they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life. \nMaybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac. \nAs a quarter of the world population is influenced by it, you'd be wise to do something about that. \nSo what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly? \nMost Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac, the signs divided into 12 months. \nThe Chinese zodiac is different. \nIt's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals, starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig, and has no association with constellations. \nFor example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit. \nCan you see your zodiac sign there? \nbased on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals. \nOver thousands of years, this popular culture has affected people's major decisions, such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other. \nAnd some of the implications are quite amazing. \nThe Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others. \nSo parents choose specific years to give birth to babies, because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families. \nWe even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations. \nI'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits. \nChinese people believe some animals are natural enemies. \nAs a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake. \nRaise your hand if you are a Snake. \nLet's have a chat later. \n We believe some animals are luckier than the others, such as the Dragon. \nUnlike the Western tradition, the Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth. \nIt's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby. \nJack Ma's parents must have been very proud. \nAnd they are not the only ones. \nIn 2012, the Year of the Dragon, the birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan increased by five percent. \nThat means another one million more babies. \nWith a traditional preference to baby boys, the boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100. \nWhen those Dragon boys grow up, they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets. \nAccording to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release, January 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections. \nWhy? \nThat was the last month for the Year of the Horse. \nIt's not because they like horses so much, it's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies. \n If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad. \nThose are Goat babies. \nThey don't look like losers to me. \n Tiger is another undesirable animal, due to its volatile temperament. \nMany Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate during those years. \nPerhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse, as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition. \nMaybe they are the lucky ones. \nI went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world, and it's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger, are at the top of the chart, even higher than the Dragon. \nSo maybe we should consider, maybe it's much better to have less competition. \nOne last but interesting point: many Chinese people make their investment decisions based on the zodiac sign index. \nAlthough the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years, the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades. \nOur ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought, famine, riot, disease and civil war. \nAnd finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology to create an ideal life they've always wanted. \nThe collective decision made by 1.3 billion people has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything, from health care and education to property and consumer goods. \nAs China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics, the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world. \nAre there any Monkeys here? \n2016 is the Year of the Monkey. \nMonkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"Have you ever been asked by your Chinese friend, \"What is your zodiac sign?\" \nDon't think they are making small talk. \nIf you say, \"I'm a Monkey,\" they immediately know you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old. \n Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age. \nBy revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated. \nJudgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune, your personality, career prospects and how you will do in a given year. \nIf you share you and your partner's animal signs, they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life. \nMaybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac. \nAs a quarter of the world population is influenced by it, you'd be wise to do something about that. \nSo what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?

\nbased on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals. \nOver thousands of years, this popular culture has affected people's major decisions, such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other. \nAnd some of the implications are quite amazing. \nThe Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others. \nSo parents choose specific years to give birth to babies, because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families. \nWe even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations. \nI'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits. \nChinese people believe some animals are natural enemies. \nAs a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake. \nRaise your hand if you are a Snake. \nLet's have a chat later. \n We believe some animals are luckier than the others, such as the Dragon. \nUnlike the Western tradition, the Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth. \nIt's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby. \nJack Ma's parents must have been very proud. \nAnd they are not the only ones. \nIn 2012, the Year of the Dragon, the birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan increased by five percent. \nThat means another one million more babies. \nWith a traditional preference to baby boys, the boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100. \nWhen those Dragon boys grow up, they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets. \nAccording to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release, January 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections. \nWhy? \nThat was the last month for the Year of the Horse. \nIt's not because they like horses so much, it's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies. \n If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad. \nThose are Goat babies. \nThey don't look like losers to me. \n Tiger is another undesirable animal, due to its volatile temperament. \nMany Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate during those years. \nPerhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse, as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition. \nMaybe they are the lucky ones. \nI went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world, and it's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger, are at the top of the chart, even higher than the Dragon. \nSo maybe we should consider, maybe it's much better to have less competition. \nOne last but interesting point: many Chinese people make their investment decisions based on the zodiac sign index. \nAlthough the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years, the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades. \nOur ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought, famine, riot, disease and civil war. \nAnd finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology to create an ideal life they've always wanted. \nThe collective decision made by 1.3 billion people has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything, from health care and education to property and consumer goods. \nAs China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics, the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world. \nAre there any Monkeys here? \n2016 is the Year of the Monkey. \nMonkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous. \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":1234,"num_sentence":58}
{"src_passage":"At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour. \nWe visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators, with inmates in our state and local prisons. \nWe've gone to immigration detention centers. \nWe've met a lot of people. \nAnd we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers, giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time. \nImagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline. \nWhat would it look like if we intervened, with rehabilitation as a core value -- with love and compassion as core values? \nWe would have a society that is safer, healthier and worthy of raising our children in. \nI want to introduce you to James Cavitt. \nJames served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison and is being released in 18 months. \nNow James, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he's done. \nHe is a father, a husband, a son, a poet. \nHe committed a crime; he's paying his debt, and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again. \nNow James, like millions of people behind bars, is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don't define who we are, that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration, we can all heal together. \nI'd like to introduce you to James right now, and he's going to share his journey of redemption James Cavitt: Thanks, John. \nTED, welcome to San Quentin. \nThe talent is abundant behind prison walls. \nFuture software engineers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, musicians and artists. \nThis piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time. \nThis piece is entitled, \"Where I Live.\" \nI live in a world where most people are too afraid to go. \nSurrounded by tall, concrete walls, steel bars, where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow. \nI live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong. \nImagine that. \nBetter yet, imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong. \nMaybe then we would all be singin' \"Redemption Song.\" \nI live in a world that has been called \"hell on Earth\" by those trapped inside. \nBut I've come to the stark realization that prison -- it really is what you make it. \nYou see, in spite of the harshness of my reality, there is a silver lining. \nI knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time. \nAnd so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile, and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom. \nAnd just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom. \nMany of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons. \nWe walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin': freedom! \nDon't you get it? \nWe're all serving time; we're just in different places. \nAs for me, I choose to be free from the prisons I've created. \nThe key: forgiveness. \nAction's my witness. \nIf we want freedom, then we gotta think different. \nBecause freedom ... \nit isn't a place. \nIt's a mind setting. \nThank you. \n  John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I. \nSold I to the merchant ships. \nMinutes after they took I from the bottomless pit. \nMy hands were made strong by the hand of the almighty. \nWe forward in this generation triumphantly. \nWon't you help to sing these songs of freedom? \n'Cause all I ever had -- redemption songs. \nRedemption songs. \nEmancipate yourselves from mental slavery. \nNone but ourselves can free our minds. \nHave no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time. \nHow long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?
