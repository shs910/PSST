Appell and Medress originally recorded another singer on the track , but decided that a different vocal approach would be preferable . Medress then approached Orlando to do the vocals . Orlando had been a professional singer in the early 1960s , but now worked as a music publishing manager for Columbia Records . Although initially worried about losing his job at Columbia , Orlando eventually agreed to lend his voice to the track .\n\" Candida \" became a worldwide hit , reaching number one in five countries , and the top ten in many others .

The composition was written by Toni Wine and Irwin Levine . For the first recording of the song , the lead vocal was done by blues singer Frankie Paris , in a style reminiscent of the Drifters . Paris 's performance was deemed unsatisfactory , and a new singer was sought for the track . Medress believed that \" an ethnic feel \" would suit the song well . He asked his friend Tony Orlando , whose heritage is Puerto Rican and Greek , to perform its lead vocal .\nOrlando , a former professional singer , had had two top @-@ 40 hits in the USA in 1961 , but later moved into the music publishing business ; in 1967 Columbia Records chose him to manage their publishing division , April @-@ Blackwood Music . When Medress approached Orlando , he was reluctant to perform on a Bell Records single , as he did not want to jeopardize his job at Columbia . Medress reassured him by saying they would use a band name for the release , and that nobody would know who the singer was . Orlando finally agreed , partly because he believed the song would be unsuccessful and would not attract any attention . He went into a studio with Appell and Medress , and sang his lead vocal over prerecorded tracks . Background vocals were done by Wine and the Tokens ' Jay Siegel ; Orlando was not present when these were recorded . By different accounts , additional background singers may have included Ellie Greenwich , Robin Grean , Leslie Miller , and Linda November .

Over time , the bridge supported increasing volumes of highway traffic and vehicles hitting the bridge . In the 1950s , an Air Force plane crashed into the bridge . Though the bridge remained structurally sound , it was becoming functionally obsolete . It had only two narrow highway lanes and no shoulders . An accident or the crossing of very large vehicles such as a large combine could force the bridge to close .\nWith river traffic increasing , damage from barge collisions increased . By 1972 , the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges than any other bridge on the Mississippi . The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi ; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge . Over the years many have not been able to make the turn quickly and have hit it .

Early on September 4 , the hurricane warning was extended northward to 25 Â° N. The threat of Hurricane Henriette prompted a Carnival Cruise Line ship to alter their route . Originally planned to tour Mexican ports , the captain turned the ship to tour the southern California coastline . Many upset passengers demanded refunds , to which the cruise line offered discounts for future cruises and a $ 40 credit card during their cruise .\nWinds of up to 100 mph ( 160 km \/ h ) in southern Baja California Sur left much of Cabo San Lucas without water or power .

{"input":"= Problem of Apollonius =\n\nIn Euclidean plane geometry , Apollonius 's problem is to construct circles that are tangent to three given circles in a plane ( Figure 1 ) . Apollonius of Perga ( ca . 262 BC â ca . 190 BC ) posed and solved this famous problem in his work á¼ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î¯ ( EpaphaÃ­ , \" Tangencies \" ) ; this work has been lost , but a 4th @-@ century report of his results by Pappus of Alexandria has survived . Three given circles generically have eight different circles that are tangent to them ( Figure 2 ) and each solution circle encloses or excludes the three given circles in a different way : in each solution , a different subset of the three circles is enclosed ( its complement is excluded ) and there are 8 subsets of a set whose cardinality is 3 , since 8 = 23 .\nIn the 16th century , Adriaan van Roomen solved the problem using intersecting hyperbolas , but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions . FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases : any of the three given circles can be shrunk to zero radius ( a point ) or expanded to infinite radius ( a line ) . ViÃ¨te 's approach , which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones , is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius ' method . The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton , who showed that Apollonius ' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points . This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN .\nLater mathematicians introduced algebraic methods , which transform a geometric problem into algebraic equations . These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries inherent in the problem of Apollonius : for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs , with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes ( Figure 2 ) . Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution , while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify the configuration of the given circles . These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods ( using Lie sphere geometry ) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles .\nApollonius ' problem has stimulated much further work . Generalizations to three dimensions â constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres â and beyond have been studied . The configuration of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention . RenÃ© Descartes gave a formula relating the radii of the solution circles and the given circles , now known as Descartes ' theorem . Solving Apollonius ' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket , which is one of the earliest fractals to be described in print , and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy â Littlewood circle method .\n\n= = Statement of the problem = =\n\nThe general statement of Apollonius ' problem is to construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane , where an object may be a line , a point or a circle of any size . These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another ; however , they are usually taken to be distinct , meaning that they do not coincide . Solutions to Apollonius ' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles , although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius .\nThe property of tangency is defined as follows . First , a point , line or circle is assumed to be tangent to itself ; hence , if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects , it is counted as a solution to Apollonius ' problem . Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common . By definition , a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them , that is , if it lies on them ; thus , two distinct points cannot be tangent . If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero , they are said to be tangent ; the intersection point is called a tangent point or a point of tangency . ( The word \" tangent \" derives from the Latin present participle , tangens , meaning \" touching \" . ) In practice , two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point ; if they intersect at zero or two points , they are not tangent . The same holds true for a line and a circle . Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane , although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry ( see below ) .\nThe solution circle may be either internally or externally tangent to each of the given circles . An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact ; they lie on opposite sides of the tangent line at that point , and they exclude one another . The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii . By contrast , an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact ; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line , and one circle encloses the other . In this case , the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii . As an illustration , in Figure 1 , the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium @-@ sized given black circle on the right , whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left .\nApollonius ' problem can also be formulated as the problem of locating one or more points such that the differences of its distances to three given points equal three known values . Consider a solution circle of radius rs and three given circles of radii r1 , r2 and r3 . If the solution circle is externally tangent to all three given circles , the distances between the center of the solution circle and the centers of the given circles equal d1","num_tokens":1367,"num_sentence":38}

{"input":"= Larabanga Mosque =\n\nThe Larabanga Mosque is a historic mosque , built in the Sudanese architectural style in the village of Larabanga , Ghana . It is the oldest mosque in the country and one of the oldest in West Africa , and has been referred to as the \" Mecca of West Africa \" . It has undergone restoration several times since it was originally founded in 1421 ( 17th century according to some ) . The World Monuments Fund ( WMF ) has contributed substantially to its restoration , and lists it as one of the 100 Most Endangered Sites . The restoration works have revived the knowledge of mud @-@ plaster maintenance .\nThe mosque has an old Quran , believed by the locals to have been given as a gift from heaven in 1650 to Yidan Barimah Bramah , the Imam at the time , as a result of his prayers . The mosque , built with mud and reeds , has two tall towers in pyramidal shape , one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on the east and the other as a minaret in the northeast corner . These are buttressed by twelve bulbous shaped structures , which are fitted with timber elements .\n\n= = Location = =\n\nThe mosque is located in the Islamic town of Larabanga , close to Damongo in the West Gonja District of the Northern Region of Ghana . The town is situated about 15 kilometers north of Damongo , and 4 kilometers south of the Mole National Park entrance .\n\n= = History = =\n\nAccording to a legend , in 1421 an Islamic trader named Ayuba had a dream while staying here , near a \" Mystic Stone \" , instructing him to build a mosque . Strangely , when he awoke , he found that the foundations were already in place and he proceeded to construct the mosque until it was completed . It is believed that Ayuba 's remains are buried under a baobab tree , next to the mosque .\nUnlike mosques situated in urban settings in West Africa , the Larabanga Mosque is comparatively small . Rural mosques , like Larabanga 's , were usually conceived by a single marabout and loosely based on styles seen elsewhere such as in the Great Mosque of DjennÃ© . In order to achieve a physical resemblance to the architecture used elsewhere , the Larabanga Mosque had to incorporate large buttresses in order to compensate for the poorer quality of building materials .\nLarabanga is one of the eight ancient and highly revered mosques in Ghana and is also its oldest . It is a place of pilgrimage and is considered the Mecca of West Africa .\nIn the 1970s , a mixture of sand and cement was applied to the external faces of the mosque hoping that it would protect the mosque from getting damaged in the wind and rain . However , this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure , with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions . This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque .\nOwing to the effect of prevailing winds and rains on the walls , the mosque has needed several renovations and restoration work which over the years have altered some of its exterior designs . In September 2002 , a severe storm destroyed the mihrab and the minaret . As a result , the World Monuments Fund ( WMF ) placed the mosque on the 2002 World Monuments Watch , also considering the damage sustained after an inappropriate restoration from the 1970s . The Ghana Museums and Monuments Board decided to fully restore the mosque and sought advice from CRAterre , an architectural firm based in Grenoble , France which has expertise in building earthen structures . The renovation work was supported by a WMF , with a grant fund of US $ 50 @,@ 000 from American Express . The local community also provided support . The conservation process involved removal of the earlier cement plaster from the surfaces of the mosque , the wooden structural components were replaced , the minaret and the mihrab were reconstructed , the portal was redone , and the interior and exterior surfaces were plastered in the traditional way . The renovation resulted in reassessing the state of conservation of the site , involving a team of local artisans and labourers . It helped to restore the monument with special emphasis on reviving the knowledge of mud @-@ plaster maintenance .\n\n= = Features = =\n\nLike other mosques in Northern Region of Ghana , Larabanga Mosque is built in the traditional Sudanic @-@ Sahelian architectural style , using local materials and construction techniques . The mosque is built with mud and reeds , and measures about 8 metres ( 26 ft ) by 8 metres ( 26 ft ) . It has two towers in pyramidal shape , one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on the east and the other as a minaret in the northeast corner . In addition , 12 buttresses of conical shape on the external walls are strengthened by horizontally @-@ aligned timber elements . The architectural style is also known as \" flat @-@ footed adobe architecture \" . All the structures are given a white wash . The mosque has an old Quran , believed by the locals to have been given as a gift from heaven in 1650 to Bramah , the Imam at the time , as a result of his prayers . The local community has also been supported in a handicraft and tourism project to generate funds not only for meeting the maintenance expenses of the mosque but also improve the economic conditions of the people .\n\n","num_tokens":1353,"num_sentence":42}

This is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles , which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used .\n\n= = = Proofs by dissection and rearrangement = = =\n\nWe have already discussed the Pythagorean proof , which was a proof by rearrangement . The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below , which consists of a large square , side a + b , containing four identical right triangles . The triangles are shown in two arrangements , the first of which leaves two squares a2 and b2 uncovered , the second of which leaves square c2 uncovered . The area encompassed by the outer square never changes , and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end , so the black square areas must be equal , therefore a2 + b2 = c2 .\nA second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation . A large square is formed with area c2 , from four identical right triangles with sides a , b and c , fitted around a small central square . Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles . Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas a2 and b2 , which must have the same area as the initial large square .\nThe third , rightmost image also gives a proof . The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading , into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse â or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two . This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called dissection . This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones .\n\n= = = Einstein 's proof by dissection without rearrangement = = =\n\nAlbert Einstein gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces need not get moved . Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs , one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse , and two similar shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse . In Einstein 's proof , the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself . The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse , thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts . Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle , and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses , and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle . Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles , the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well .\n\n= = = Algebraic proofs = = =\n\nThe theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides a , b and c , arranged inside a square with side c as in the top half of the diagram .

Garfield ( then a U.S. Representative ) . Instead of a square it uses a trapezoid , which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square , to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram . The area of the trapezoid can be calculated to be half the area of the square , that is\n<formula>\nThe inner square is similarly halved , and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of <formula> , which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result .\n\n= = = Proof using differentials = = =\n\nOne can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing calculus .\nThe triangle ABC is a right triangle , as shown in the upper part of the diagram , with BC the hypotenuse .

{"input":"= Frog battery =\n\nA frog battery is an electrochemical battery consisting of a number of dead frogs ( or sometimes live ones ) , which form the cells of the battery connected in a series arrangement . It is a kind of biobattery . It was used in early scientific investigations of electricity and academic demonstrations .\nThe principle behind the battery is the injury potential created in a muscle when it is damaged , although this was not fully understood in the 18th and 19th centuries ; the potential being caused incidentally due to the dissection of the frog 's muscles .\nThe frog battery is an example of a class of biobatteries which can be made from any number of animals . The general term for an example of this class is the muscular pile .\nThe first well known frog battery was created by Carlo Matteucci in 1845 , but there had been others before him . Matteucci also created batteries out of other animals , and Giovanni Aldini created a battery from ox heads .\n\n= = Background = =\n\nIn the early days of electrical research , a common method of detecting electric current was by means of a frog 's leg galvanoscope . A good supply of live frogs was kept to hand by the researcher ready to have their legs prepared for the galvanoscope . Frogs were therefore a convenient material to use in other experiments . They were small , easily handled , the legs were especially sensitive to electric current , and they carried on responding longer than other animal candidates for this role .\n\n= = Preparation = =\n\nIt was usual to use the thighs of frogs for the battery construction . The legs of the frog were first skinned , then the lower leg was cut off at the knee joint and discarded . Damaging the muscle during this procedure would detract from the results . The thigh muscle was then cut in two transversely to produce two half @-@ thighs . Only the lower , conical shaped piece was kept . The half @-@ thighs were then laid on an insulator of varnished wood so arranged that the inside surface of one was in contact with the outside surface of the next , with the conical ends of the outside surface being pushed into the cavity of the cut surface . The ends of the pile were placed in cups of water sunk into the wood and formed the terminals of the battery .\nThe arrangement of inside surface connected to outside surface was on the basis of the incorrect theory that there was an electric current in muscles continually flowing from the inside to the outside . It is now known that the half @-@ thighs were more successful at generating electricity because they had suffered the greatest injury to the muscle . This effect of increased electric potential due to injury is known as demarcation potential or injury potential .\nOther constructions could also be used . For instance the complete rear legs could be used with the sciatic nerves exposed so that the nerve of one frog could be connected to the feet of the next . Whole frogs too could be used . Although it was more time consuming to prepare the thigh muscles , most experimenters preferred to do this since it gave better results .\n\n= = History = =\n\nThe first frog battery was constructed by Eusebio Valli in the 1790s with a chain of 10 frogs . Valli had difficulty understanding all of his own results ; he followed Luigi Galvani in believing that animal electricity ( or galvanic electricity ) was a different phenomenon from metal @-@ metal electricity ( or voltaic electricity ) , even denying its existence . Alessandro Volta 's theory was proved correct when he succeeded in constructing the voltaic pile without the use of any animal material . Because Valli found himself on the wrong side in this dispute , and refused to change his opinion despite the evidence , his work has become a bit of a backwater and his frog battery is little known and poorly documented .\nLeopoldo Nobili built a frog battery in 1818 out of complete frog legs which he called a frog pile . He used this to investigate animal electricity but his experiments were strongly criticised by Volta who argued that the true source of electricity was dissimilar metals in the external circuit . According to Volta , fluids in the frog merely provided the electrolyte .\nThe first well @-@ known frog battery was constructed by Carlo Matteucci which was described in a paper presented to the Royal Society in 1845 by Michael Faraday on his behalf . It later also appeared in the popular medical student physics textbook Elements of Natural Philosophy by Golding Bird . Matteucci constructed his battery from a pile of 12 to 14 half @-@ thighs of frogs . Despite the misguided theory behind the half @-@ thigh battery , Matteucci 's frog battery was nevertheless sufficiently powerful to decompose potassium iodide . Matteucci aimed with this apparatus to address Volta 's criticism of Nobili by constructing a circuit , as far as possible , entirely out of biological material and hence prove the existence of animal electricity . Matteucci also studied the effects vacuum , various gases , and poisons had on the frog battery , concluding that in many cases its operation was not affected even when the substance would be toxic or lethal to the living animal .\nFrogs were not the only creatures to be press @-@ ganged into serving as battery components . In 1803 Giovanni Aldini demonstrated that electricity could be obtained from an ox head from a freshly killed animal . A frog galvanoscope connected between the ox 's tongue and ear showed a reaction when the circuit was completed through the experimenter 's own body . A greater reaction was obtained when Aldini joined two or three heads together into a battery . Later , in the 1840s , Matteucci also created eel batteries , pigeon batteries and rabbit batteries . Further , he created a battery out of living pigeons by connecting a wound made on the breast of one pigeon to the body of the next . Matteucci states that this design was based on a pre @-@ existing battery of living frogs .\n\n","num_tokens":1392,"num_sentence":50}

Though convection decreased early on August 21 , the area of low pressure remained well @-@ organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Four late on August 21 . Water temperatures remained warm enough for development , while upper level shear was minimal as the depression moved west @-@ northwestward due to a ridge of high pressure to its north . Initial predictions by the National Hurricane Center also forecast a motion to the northwest based on consistent model predictions , though , as quoted by forecaster James Franklin , \" The models have also been excellently wrong thus far \" .\nDespite a decrease in convection shortly after forming , the large depression remained well organized , with a wind field 575 mi ( 930 km ) in diameter . On August 22 , as it passed 140 mi ( 225 km ) to south of the Cape Verde islands , deep convection developed over the center of circulation , and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300 mi ( 485 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened , and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km \/ h ) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean . Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status , while its projected path placed the storm in an area of warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear .\nShortly after reaching its peak intensity , Debby encountered an area of dry air , and subsequently weakened . The low level circulation detached itself from the diminishing convection while the system as a whole continued west @-@ northwestward . Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center , while banding features redeveloped as well . Organization continued , and Debby again reached its peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km \/ h ) on August 24 . Southerly wind shear displaced the convection to the north of the center , and Debby weakened to a minimal tropical storm on August 25 . The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated , and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression . Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure . The low turned to the north and north @-@ northeast ahead of an approaching trough , and on August 28 the low dissipated .\n\n= = Preparation and Impact = =\n\nThe government of the Cape Verde islands issued a tropical storm warning coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on Tropical Depression Four , meaning tropical storm conditions were expected in the area within 24 hours . The National Hurricane Center stated that heavy rainfall , potentially as high as 10 in ( 250 mm ) in mountainous areas , would be possible in the territory , possibly causing life @-@ threatening flash floods and mudslides . However , due to a reformation further to the south , tropical storm warnings were discontinued as the depression moved from the area . While passing around 115 mi ( 185 km ) to the southwest of the southwestern most islands , the depression produced a 35 mph ( 55 km \/ h ) wind gust at Fogo and some rainfall , though no damage was reported .\nLong range forecasts brought the storm near Bermuda . However Debby remained over 900 mi ( 1 @,@ 450 km ) from the island at its closest approach . Though the storm was forecast to remain far away from the Gulf of Mexico , investors tracking the storm caused the price of crude oil to rise 60 cents a barrel due to the potential impact to oil installations .\n\n","num_tokens":1182,"num_sentence":34}

The generic name Polytolypa is from the Greek word poly ( ÏÎ¿Î»Ï ) meaning \" many \" , and tolype ( ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÏÎ· ) , meaning \" skein of yarn \" . The specific epithet hystricis comes from the Greek hystrix ( ÏÏÏÏÎ¹Î¾ ) , or \" porcupine \" .\nThe genus has been classified in the Onygenaceae , a fungal family characterized by species capable of digesting human hair in vitro , and with spores that are punctate ( with minute surface punctures ) when viewed with scanning electron microscopy . However , as Scott and colleagues demonstrated using traditional laboratory tests to determine keratinolytic activity , P. hystricus is not able to digest hair . There is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic relationships with other similar genera . Polytolypa is thought to be evolutionarily most closely related to the genera Malbranchea and Spiromastix . The grouping of Polytolypa and Spiromastix represent a sister clade to the Ajellomyces clade , based on analysis of partial nuclear LSU sequence data . However , the phylogenetics of Polytolypa are still unclear and await further study . The 10th edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi ( 2008 ) considers the genus to be in the Ajellomycetaceae family , although uncertainty with this classification is indicated in the entry ; in contrast , the online mycological database MycoBank classifies the genus in the Onygenaceae .\n\n= = Description = =\n\nThe ascus @-@ containing reproductive structures , or ascomata , are minute , spherical bodies , typically 200 â 400 Î¼m in diameter .

In 1973 , the young mathematician Claude LemarÃ©chal was surprised by his success with convex minimization methods on problems that were known to be non @-@ convex ; for minimizing nonlinear problems , a solution of the dual problem problem need not provide useful information for solving the primal problem , unless the primal problem be convex and satisfy a constraint qualification .

In the other direction , probability theory provides tools to examine convex sets generally and the Shapley â Folkman â Starr results specifically . The Shapley â Folkman â Starr results have been widely used in the probabilistic theory of random sets , for example , to prove a law of large numbers , a central limit theorem , and a large @-@ deviations principle . These proofs of probabilistic limit theorems used the Shapley â Folkman â Starr results to avoid the assumption that all the random sets be convex .\nA probability measure is a finite measure , and the Shapley â Folkman lemma has applications in non @-@ probabilistic measure theory , such as the theories of volume and of vector measures . The Shapley â Folkman lemma enables a refinement of the Brunn â Minkowski inequality , which bounds the volume of sums in terms of the volumes of their summand @-@ sets . The volume of a set is defined in terms of the Lebesgue measure , which is defined on subsets of Euclidean space . In advanced measure @-@ theory , the Shapley â Folkman lemma has been used to prove Lyapunov 's theorem , which states that the range of a vector measure is convex . Here , the traditional term \" range \" ( alternatively , \" image \" ) is the set of values produced by the function . A vector measure is a vector @-@ valued generalization of a measure ; for example , if p1 and p2 are probability measures defined on the same measurable space , then the product function p1 p2 is a vector measure , where p1 p2 is defined for every event Ï by\n( p1 p2 ) ( Ï ) = ( p1 ( Ï ) , p2 ( Ï ) ) .\nLyapunov 's theorem has been used in economics , in ( \" bang @-@ bang \" ) control theory , and in statistical theory . Lyapunov 's theorem has been called a continuous counterpart of the Shapley â Folkman lemma , which has itself been called a discrete analogue of Lyapunov 's theorem .\n\n","num_tokens":1162,"num_sentence":29}

The Reading store 's first several hours had no sales . However , after the partners took a lunchtime walk , they returned at 1 : 30 to find the local factory workers had been let out at 1 : 00 â with their paychecks . Sales were brisk , and the partners never looked back . His second store , in Newark , New Jersey , was short lived , but his partnership thrived nonetheless .

The center became disorganized and quickly dissipated , bringing a large area of moisture which dropped up to 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of rainfall to southwestern Mexico . Rainfall from the storm flooded about 150 houses , of which 20 were destroyed . One person was injured , and initially there were reports of two people missing due to the storm ; however , it was not later confirmed .\n\n= = Meteorological history = =\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 21 , moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development .

Located over warm water temperatures , the system developed an area of organized , deep convection near the center ; with satellite intensity estimates of tropical storm force using the Dvorak technique , the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman about 12 hours after it first formed . Strengthening continued , and Norman attained peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km \/ h ) early on October 10 . At the time , it was officially forecast to strengthen further and continue northeastward . However , some hurricane prediction models anticipated quick weakening and a sharp turn to the southeast . Shortly after peaking in intensity , southwesterly wind shear increased , which led to a decrease in convection coverage . At the same time , a trough extending from California southward caused Norman to stall and turn to the east . The convection rapidly became separated from the center ; by late on October 10 , the center was located about 115 miles ( 185 km ) from the nearest thunderstorms .

{"input":"= The Restoration ( 1910 film ) =\n\nThe Restoration is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film focuses on Hugh Logan , a single father who leaves his little girl , May , at home when he goes on a business trip . On the way to the city he is attacked by robbers and left in the road . He is found and taken in , but he suffers from amnesia . He falls in love with Maud Neals and proposes to her . Due to the prolonged absence of her father , May is taken to an orphan asylum , but she escapes . May goes to the city and ends up stopping to sleep on the doorstep of the Neals ' home . Maud finds her and takes her in , where Logan recognizes his daughter and his memory comes back . Little is known of the production credits , but the film does feature Marie Eline as the little girl . It was released on August 5 , 1910 and was met with mixed reviews . The film is presumed lost .\n\n= = Plot = =\n\nThough the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6 , 1910 . It states : \" Hugh Logan is a widower who lives with his only child , a little girl , in a small cottage in the country . Logan is a commercial traveler and , as the play opens , is preparing to leave on a business trip . He takes the train to the city , where he is attacked by footpads , who leave him unconscious in the roadway . He is found by Maud Neal and her father , who are passing in an auto , and they take him into their home . There he revives , but the shock has affected his memory , and he is unable to recall anything of his past life . The kindly Neal secures him employment , and as time passes Logan falls deeply in love with Maud . He finally proposes to her and it is accepted . In the meantime , little May has been waiting in vain for her father . As no word is received from him , and she has no other relatives , Bridget , the servant , takes her to the orphan asylum , where she is compelled to make her home with other little unfortunates . May dislikes the place . In the end she escapes from it . But , gaining the city , she gets lost there and , tired and hungry , goes to sleep on a doorstep - the Neals ' . There she is found by Maud , who takes her into the house . Maud is much attracted by the child 's charms and finally decides that she must never be parted from her . She tells Logan of her decision and he objects . They quarrel . Feeling himself in the wrong , Logan returns and asks Maud 's pardon . He meets May , who recognizes her father . At the sight of her , his memory returns . Speedily he determines to retain May from out of the things of the old life , and Maud from out of the new . \"\n\n= = Production = =\n\nThe writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . Lonergan liked to use the deus ex machina dramatic technique in the conclusion of the plots and this production was no exception . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The only cast credit claimed by Bowers is that of Marie Eline as the little girl . Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions . Known and more prominent members of the cast to appear in productions include the leading ladies , Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming , and the leading man was Frank H. Crane .\n\n= = Release and reception = =\n\nThe single reel drama , approximately 1000 feet long , was released on August 5 , 1910 . Curiously , The Moving Picture World makes a reference to aphasia instead of amnesia in advertising the film , \" The Friday release ( August 5 ) is a gripping heart @-@ drama , by name The Restoration . It is a curious , a novel thing ; in a sense a study in aphasia - one of those weird plots you expect a Thanhouser picture to unfold . \" The film likely had a wide national release as evidenced by numerous advertisements , including theaters in Maryland , Indiana , and Kansas . Some advertisements for The Restoration were not specific and may refer to D. W. Griffith 's 1909 The Restoration . These advertisements are noted in Oregon , Washington , and North Carolina .\nThe film received mixed reviews , but also criticism for several aspects of the production . The Morning Telegraph stated , \" The photography at the beginning of the film is poor . It seems queer that the child should be able to escape from the orphan asylum in such an easy manner and that no search be made by the institution . It seemed very theatrical and hardly possible that the child should make the first stop at the house of the father 's intended . Why did not the producer have the child make a few more stops or have something happen to her instead of making the first stop at the woman 's house ? \" The The Moving Picture World spared little coverage of the actual film in its review , noting that the emotional story might be a plausible . The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a detailed review that found the acting favorable , but found the plot and its resolution to be fantastical by stating , \" The manifest absurdity of this plot lies in the adoption . No girl just betrothed would ever adopt a runaway orphan . \"\n\n","num_tokens":1389,"num_sentence":62}

{"input":"= Central dense overcast =\n\nThe central dense overcast , or CDO , of a tropical cyclone or strong subtropical cyclone is the large central area of thunderstorms surrounding its circulation center , caused by the formation of its eye wall . It can be round , angular , oval , or irregular in shape . This feature shows up in tropical cyclones of tropical storm or hurricane strength . How far the center is embedded within the CDO , and the temperature difference between the cloud tops within the CDO and the cyclone 's eye , can help determine a tropical cyclone 's intensity . Locating the center within the CDO can be a problem for strong tropical storms and with systems of minimal hurricane strength as its location can be obscured by the CDO 's high cloud canopy . This center location problem can be resolved through the use of microwave satellite imagery .\nAfter a cyclone reaches hurricane intensity , an eye appears at the center of the CDO , defining its center of low pressure and its cyclonic wind field . Tropical cyclones with changing intensity have more lightning within their CDO than steady state storms . Tracking cloud features within the CDO , using frequently updated satellite imagery , can also be used to determine its intensity . The highest maximum sustained winds within a tropical cyclone , as well as its heaviest rainfall , are usually located under the coldest cloud tops in the CDO .\n\n= = Characteristics = =\n\nIt is a large region of thunderstorms surrounding the center of stronger tropical and subtropical cyclones which shows up brightly ( with cold cloud tops ) on satellite imagery . The CDO forms due to the development of an eyewall within a tropical cyclone . Its shape can be round , oval , angular , or irregular . Its development can be preceded by a narrow , dense , C @-@ shaped convective band . Early in its development , the CDO is often angular or oval in shape , which rounds out , increases in size , and appears more smooth as a tropical cyclone intensifies . Rounder CDO shapes occur in environments with low levels of vertical wind shear .\nThe strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection within the CDO , which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops . The radius of maximum wind is usually collocated with the coldest cloud tops within the CDO , which is also the area where a tropical cyclone 's rainfall reaches its maximum intensity . For mature tropical cyclones that are steady state , the CDO contains nearly no lightning activity , though lightning is more common within weaker tropical cyclones and for systems fluctuating in intensity .\n\n= = Eye = =\n\nThe eye is a region of mostly calm weather at the center of the CDO of strong tropical cyclones . The eye of a storm is a roughly circular area , typically 30 â 65 km ( 20 â 40 miles ) in diameter . It is surrounded by the eyewall , a ring of towering thunderstorms surrounding its center of circulation . The cyclone 's lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye , and can be as much as 15 % lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the storm . In weaker tropical cyclones , the eye is less well @-@ defined , and can be covered by high cloudiness caused by cirrus cloud outflow from the surrounding central dense overcast .\n\n= = Use as a tropical cyclone strength indicator = =\n\nWithin the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The central dense overcast ( CDO ) pattern is one of those patterns . The central dense overcast utilizes the size of the CDO . The CDO pattern intensities start at T2.5 , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity , 40 mph ( 64 km \/ h ) . The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered . The farther the center is tucked into the CDO , the stronger it is deemed . Banding features can be utilized to objectively determine the tropical cyclone 's center , using a ten degree logarithmic spiral . Using the 85 â 92 GHz channels of polar @-@ orbiting microwave satellite imagery can definitively locate the center within the CDO .\nTropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 mph ( 105 km \/ h ) and 100 mph ( 160 km \/ h ) can have their center of circulations obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge .

{"input":"= Î± , rk â 1 =\nÎ² , and every remainder is strictly smaller than its predecessor , | rk | < | rk â 1 | . The first difference is that the quotients and remainders are themselves Gaussian integers , and thus are complex numbers . The quotients qk are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio ( such as the complex number Î± \/ Î² ) to the nearest integers . The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be \" smaller \" than another . To do this , a norm function f ( u + vi ) = u2 + v2 is defined , which converts every Gaussian integer u + vi into a normal integer . After each step k of the Euclidean algorithm , the norm of the remainder f ( rk ) is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder , f ( rk â 1 ) . Since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases with every step , the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps . The final nonzero remainder is the gcd ( Î± , Î² ) , the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both Î± and Î² ; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit , Â± 1 or Â± i .\nMany of the other applications of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers . For example , it can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for Gaussian integers ; continued fractions of Gaussian integers can also be defined .\n\n= = = Euclidean domains = = =\n\nA set of elements under two binary operations , + and â , is called a Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and , roughly speaking , if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them . The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic ; rather , they can be more general , such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid . Nevertheless , these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic , such as commutativity , associativity and distributivity .\nThe generalized Euclidean algorithm requires a Euclidean function , i.e. , a mapping f from R into the set of nonnegative integers such that , for any two nonzero elements a and b in R , there exist q and r in R such that a\n= qb + r and f ( r ) < f ( b ) . An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above . The function f can be the magnitude of the number , or the degree of a polynomial . The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably ; hence , if f can be reduced only a finite number of times , the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps . This principle relies heavily on the natural well @-@ ordering of the non @-@ negative integers ; roughly speaking , this requires that every non @-@ empty set of non @-@ negative integers has a smallest member .\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic applies to any Euclidean domain : Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements . Any Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain ( UFD ) , although the converse is not true . The Euclidean domains and the UFD 's are subclasses of the GCD domains , domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists . In other words , a greatest common divisor may exist ( for all pairs of elements in a domain ) , although it may not be possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm . A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain ( PID ) , an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal . Again , the converse is not true : not every PID is a Euclidean domain .\nThe unique factorization of Euclidean domains is useful in many applications . For example , the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat 's theorem on sums of two squares . Unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of Fermat 's Last Theorem published in 1847 by Gabriel LamÃ© , the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid 's algorithm , based on a suggestion of Joseph Liouville . LamÃ© 's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form x + Ïy , where x and y are integers , and Ï =\ne2iÏ \/ n is an nth root of 1 , that is , Ïn = 1 . Although this approach succeeds for some values of n ( such as n = 3 , the Eisenstein integers ) , in general such numbers do not factor uniquely . This failure of unique factorization in some cyclotomic fields led Ernst Kummer to the concept of ideal numbers and , later , Richard Dedekind to ideals .\n\n= = = = Unique factorization of quadratic integers = = = =\n\nThe quadratic integer rings are helpful to illustrate Euclidean domains . Quadratic integers are generalizations of the Gaussian integers in which the imaginary unit i is replaced by a number Ï .

It is a relatively close star at only 25 light @-@ years from Earth , and , together with Arcturus and Sirius , one of the most luminous stars in the Sun 's neighborhood .\nVega has been extensively studied by astronomers , leading it to be termed â arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun . â Vega was the northern pole star around 12 @,@ 000 BC and will be so again around the year 13 @,@ 727 when the declination will be + 86 Â° 14 ' .

Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale , and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system .\nVega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun , but since it is 2 @.@ 1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun ; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies . Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium . Vega is also a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner . It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274 km \/ s at the equator . This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects , and , as a result , there is a variation of temperature across the star 's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles . From Earth , Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles .\nBased on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation , Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust . This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk , which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System . Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega @-@ like stars .\n\n= = Observation history = =\n\nAstrophotography , the photography of celestial objects , began in 1840 when John William Draper took an image of the Moon using the daguerreotype process . On July 17 , 1850 , Vega became the first star ( other than the Sun ) to be photographed , when it was imaged by William Bond and John Adams Whipple at the Harvard College Observatory , also with a daguerreotype . Henry Draper took the first photograph of a star 's spectrum in August 1872 when he took an image of Vega , and he also became the first person to show absorption lines in the spectrum of a star . Similar lines had already been identified in the spectrum of the Sun . In 1879 , William Huggins used photographs of the spectra of Vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve \" very strong lines \" that were common to this stellar category . These were later identified as lines from the Hydrogen Balmer series . Since 1943 , the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified .\nThe distance to Vega can be determined by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun . The first person to publish a star 's parallax was Friedrich G. W. von Struve , when he announced a value of 0 @.@ 125 arcseconds ( 0 @.@ 125 â³ ) for Vega . But Friedrich Bessel was skeptical about Struve 's data , and , when Bessel published a parallax of 0 @.@ 314 â³ for the star system 61 Cygni , Struve revised his value for Vega 's parallax to nearly double the original estimate . This change cast further doubt on Struve 's data . Thus most astronomers at the time , including Struve , credited Bessel with the first published parallax result . However , Struve 's initial result was actually surprisingly close to the currently accepted value of 0 @.@ 129 â³ , as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite .\nThe brightness of a star , as seen from Earth , is measured with a standardized , logarithmic scale . This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of the star . The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude , while the brightest , Sirius , is of magnitude â 1 @.@ 46 . To standardize the magnitude scale , astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths . Thus , for many years , Vega was used as a baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales . However , this is no longer the case , as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux . This approach is more convenient for astronomers , since Vega is not always available for calibration .\nThe UBV photometric system measures the magnitude of stars through ultraviolet , blue , and yellow filters , producing U , B , and V values , respectively .

{"input":"= Avogadro constant =\n\nIn chemistry and physics , the Avogadro constant ( named after the scientist Amedeo Avogadro ) is the number of constituent particles , usually atoms or molecules , that are contained in the amount of substance given by one mole . Thus , it is the proportionality factor that relates the molar mass of a compound to the mass of a sample . Avogadro 's constant , often designated with the symbol NA or L , has the value 6 @.@ 022140857 ( 74 ) Ã 1023 mol â 1 in the International System of Units ( SI ) .\nPrevious definitions of chemical quantity involved Avogadro 's number , a historical term closely related to the Avogadro constant , but defined differently : Avogadro 's number was initially defined by Jean Baptiste Perrin as the number of atoms in one gram @-@ molecule of atomic hydrogen , meaning one gram of hydrogen . This number is also known as Loschmidt constant in German literature . The constant was later redefined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of the isotope carbon @-@ 12 ( 12C ) , and still later generalized to relate amounts of a substance to their molecular weight . For instance , to a first approximation , 1 gram of hydrogen element ( H ) , having the atomic ( mass ) number 1 , has 6 @.@ 022 Ã 1023 hydrogen atoms . Similarly , 12 grams of 12C , with the mass number 12 ( atomic number 6 ) , has the same number of carbon atoms , 6 @.@ 022 Ã 1023 . Avogadro 's number is a dimensionless quantity , and has the same numerical value of the Avogadro constant given in base units . In contrast , the Avogadro constant has the dimension of reciprocal amount of substance .\nRevisions in the base set of SI units necessitated redefinitions of the concepts of chemical quantity . Avogadro 's number , and its definition , was deprecated in favor of the Avogadro constant and its definition . Changes in the SI units are proposed to fix the value of the constant to exactly 6.02214X Ã 1023 when it is expressed in the unit mol â 1 , in which an \" X \" at the end of a number means one or more final digits yet to be agreed upon .\n\n= = History = =\n\nThe Avogadro constant is named after the early 19th @-@ century Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro , who , in 1811 , first proposed that the volume of a gas ( at a given pressure and temperature ) is proportional to the number of atoms or molecules regardless of the nature of the gas . The French physicist Jean Perrin in 1909 proposed naming the constant in honor of Avogadro . Perrin won the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics , largely for his work in determining the Avogadro constant by several different methods .\nThe value of the Avogadro constant was first indicated by Johann Josef Loschmidt , who in 1865 estimated the average diameter of the molecules in air by a method that is equivalent to calculating the number of particles in a given volume of gas . This latter value , the number density <formula> of particles in an ideal gas , is now called the Loschmidt constant in his honor , and is related to the Avogadro constant , NA , by\n<formula>\nwhere p0 is the pressure , R is the gas constant and T0 is the absolute temperature . The connection with Loschmidt is the root of the symbol L sometimes used for the Avogadro constant , and German @-@ language literature may refer to both constants by the same name , distinguished only by the units of measurement .\nAccurate determinations of Avogadro 's number require the measurement of a single quantity on both the atomic and macroscopic scales using the same unit of measurement . This became possible for the first time when American physicist Robert Millikan measured the charge on an electron in 1910 . The electric charge per mole of electrons is a constant called the Faraday constant and had been known since 1834 when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis . By dividing the charge on a mole of electrons by the charge on a single electron the value of Avogadro 's number is obtained . Since 1910 , newer calculations have more accurately determined the values for the Faraday constant and the elementary charge .

The change in name to Avogadro constant ( NA ) came with the introduction of the mole as a base unit in the International System of Units ( SI ) in 1971 , which recognized amount of substance as an independent dimension of measurement . With this recognition , the Avogadro constant was no longer a pure number , but had a unit of measurement , the reciprocal mole ( mol â 1 ) .\nWhile it is rare to use units of amount of substance other than the mole , the Avogadro constant can also be expressed in units such as the pound mole ( lb @-@ mol ) and the ounce mole ( oz @-@ mol ) .\nNA","num_tokens":1277,"num_sentence":34}
