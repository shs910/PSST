These prestigious awards are presented annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to honor excellence in the recording industry, focusing on artistic achievement and technical proficiency rather than commercial success or chart rankings.\n\nIn 1991, the Academy introduced the Best Rap Solo Performance category to recognize outstanding individual rap performances. In 2003, this category was divided into Female and Male Rap Solo Performances. However, in 2005, the gender-specific categories were merged into a single category known as Best Rap Solo Performance. Notably, American artist Missy Elliott clinched the Best Female Rap Solo Performance award in both years it was established.\n\n= = Background = =\n\nThe Academy's recognition of individual rap performances began in 1991 with the inception of the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. This category was later divided into separate awards for Female and Male Rap Solo Performances in 2004, remaining gender-specific for a brief period. By 2005, the categories were combined into a unified, gender-neutral category named Best Rap Solo Performance. Female rapper MC Lyte has advocated for reinstating gender-specific categories in hip-hop to provide a diverse perspective. Conversely, industry insiders attribute the elimination of gender-specific categories to a lack of competition and representation. Despite ongoing discussions, the category name has remained unchanged since 2005.\n\n= = Recipients = =\n\nAt the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003, nominees for Best Female Rap Solo Performance included artists such as Charli Baltimore, Missy Elliott, Eve, Foxy Brown, and Lauryn Hill. Missy Elliott was also nominated in the Best Short Form Music Video category. The award ceremony, held at Madison Square Garden in New York City, saw Elliott receiving the accolade.\nFor the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004, nominees for Best Female Rap Solo Performance featured Da Brat, Missy Elliott, Lil' Kim, MC Lyte, and Queen Latifah. Missy Elliott, a multiple nominee that year, won the award for her track \"Work It.\" This victory added to her previous win in the Best Rap Solo Performance category and made her the sole female artist to achieve this feat multiple times. In subsequent years, Elliott continued to be recognized in the gender-neutral Best Rap Solo Performance category."}

The first method, exemplified by the leftmost animation, features a large square with sides a + b containing four identical right triangles.

This method, known as dissection, proves that the large square area equals that of the two smaller squares.\n\nAlbert Einstein provided a proof by dissection without rearrangement, using shapes that include the hypotenuse and legs of a right triangle. By dissecting the triangle without moving pieces, the relationship between the areas of the triangles and squares of the sides is established.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem can also be algebraically proven by using multiple right triangles inside a square, leading to the relationship between the areas of the triangles and squares of their sides. Various methods, including one by James A. Garfield, are presented to algebraically demonstrate the theorem using different geometric shapes.\n\nFurthermore, the Pythagorean theorem can be derived using differentials by analyzing how changes in side lengths affect the hypotenuse, applying calculus to arrive at the equation and solve it through integration."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive U.S. responses to Iran s forces, its Shi ite Muslim proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups, according to six current and former U.S. officials. The proposal was prepared by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other top officials, and presented to Trump at a National Security Council meeting on Friday, the sources said. It could be agreed and made public before the end of September, two of the sources said. All of the sources are familiar with the draft and requested anonymity because Trump has yet to act on it. In contrast to detailed instructions handed down by President Barack Obama and some of his predecessors, Trump is expected to set broad strategic objectives and goals for U.S. policy but leave it to U.S. military commanders, diplomats and other U.S. officials to implement the plan, said a senior administration official.  Whatever we end up with, we want to implement with allies to the greatest extent possible,  the official added. The White House declined to comment. The plan is intended to increase the pressure on Tehran to curb its ballistic missile programs and support for militants, several sources said.  I would call it a broad strategy for the range of Iranian malign activities: financial materials, support for terror, destabilization in the region, especially Syria and Iraq and Yemen,  said another senior administration official.    The proposal also targets cyber espionage and other activity and potentially nuclear proliferation, the official said. The administration is still debating a new stance on a 2015 agreement, sealed by Obama, to curb Iran s nuclear weapons program. The draft urges consideration of tougher economic sanctions if Iran violates the 2015 agreement. The proposal includes more aggressive U.S. interceptions of Iranian arms shipments such as those to Houthi rebels in Yemen and Palestinian groups in Gaza and Egypt s Sinai, a current official and a knowledgeable former U.S. official said. The plan also recommends the United States react more aggressively in Bahrain, whose Sunni Muslim monarchy has been suppressing majority Shi ites, who are demanding reforms, the sources said. In addition, U.S. naval forces could react more forcefully when harassed by armed speed boats operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran s paramilitary and espionage contingent, three of the sources said. U.S. ships have fired flares and warning shots to drive off IRGC boats that made what were viewed as threatening approaches after refusing to heed radio warnings in the passageway for 35 percent of the world s seaborne petroleum exports. U.S. commanders now are permitted to open fire only when they think their vessels and the lives of their crews are endangered. The sources offered no details of the proposed changes in the rules, which are classified. The plan does not include an escalation of U.S. military activity in Syria and Iraq. Trump s national security aides argued that a more muscular military response to Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq would complicate the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, which they argued should remain the top priority, four of the sources said. Mattis and McMaster, as well as the heads of the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Forces Command, have opposed allowing U.S. commanders in Syria and Iraq to react more forcefully to provocations by the IRGC, Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed Shi ite militias, the four sources said. The advisers are concerned that more permissive rules of engagement would divert U.S. forces from defeating the remnants of Islamic State, they said. Moreover, looser rules could embroil the United States in a conflict with Iran while U.S. forces remain overstretched, and Trump has authorized a small troop increase for Afghanistan, said one senior administration official. A former U.S. official said Hezbollah and Iranian-backed Shi ite militias in Iraq have been  very helpful  in recapturing vast swaths of the caliphate that Islamic State declared in Syria and Iran in 2014. U.S. troops supporting Kurdish and Sunni Arab fighters battling Islamic State in Syria have been wrestling with how to respond to hostile actions by Iranian-backed forces. In some of the most notable cases, U.S. aircraft shot down two Iranian-made drones in June. Both were justified as defensive acts narrowly tailored to halt an imminent threat on the ground. Trump s opposition to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), poses a dilemma for policymakers. Most of his national security aides favor remaining in the pact, as do U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia despite their reservations about Iran s adherence to the agreement, said U.S. officials involved in the discussions.  The main issue for us was to get the president not to discard the JCPOA. But he had very strong feelings, backed by (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) Nikki Haley, that they should be more aggressive with Iran,  one of the two U.S. officials said.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering a strategy that could enable more assertive U.S. actions towards Iran's forces, its Shi'ite Muslim allies in Iraq and Syria, and its backing for extremist groups, as per six present and former U.S. officials. The suggestion, put together by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and other high-ranking officials, was laid out before Trump at a National Security Council session on Friday, disclosed the sources. It might be finalized and disclosed before September concludes, two sources suggested. All individuals familiar with the draft requested anonymity as Trump has not taken action on it yet. Unlike the detailed directives given by President Barack Obama and previous presidents, Trump is anticipated to establish broad strategic aims and targets for U.S. policy, delegating the execution of the plan to U.S. military leaders, diplomats, and other officials, a senior administration representative mentioned. \"Regardless of the final plan, our intention is to implement it with allies to the fullest extent possible,\" the official noted. The White House opted not to comment. The objective of the plan is to intensify pressure on Tehran to rein in its ballistic missile programs and support for extremists, indicated several sources. \"I'd characterize it as a comprehensive strategy against various hostile actions by Iran: financial aid, backing of terrorism, destabilization in regions like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen,\" said another senior administration official. Additionally, the proposal targets cyber espionage, nuclear proliferation, and other activities, as per the official. The administration is still deliberating a new approach to the 2015 agreement, negotiated by Obama, aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear weapons program. The draft encourages the consideration of stricter economic sanctions if Iran breaches the 2015 agreement. The proposal includes more aggressive interception of Iranian arms deliveries to groups like Houthi rebels in Yemen and Palestinian factions in Gaza and Egypt's Sinai, as mentioned by a current official and a well-informed former U.S. official. The plan also recommends heightened U.S. involvement in Bahrain, where the Sunni Muslim ruling family has been suppressing the predominantly Shiite population calling for reforms, the sources reported. Additionally, U.S. naval forces could respond more robustly when faced with Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' armed speedboats, a paramilitary and espionage unit, according to three sources. American vessels have discharged flares and warning shots to deter IRGC boats making what were perceived as threatening approaches after disregarding radio warnings in the strait that accounts for 35% of the world's seaborne oil exports. Currently, U.S. commanders are only allowed to engage when they believe their ships and crews are in immediate danger. The sources did not disclose the specifics of the proposed changes to the rules, which are classified. The plan excludes an escalation of U.S. military operations in Syria and Iraq. Trump's national security advisers argued that a more forceful military response against Iranian allies in Syria and Iraq could complicate the ongoing U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State, which they argued should remain the top priority, as per four sources. Mattis, McMaster, along with the heads of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Forces Command, have opposed granting U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq more latitude in responding to provocations by the IRGC, Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed Shiite militias, the sources revealed. These advisers are concerned that looser rules of engagement could divert U.S. forces from the defeat of the remaining Islamic State forces. Moreover, relaxed regulations could potentially drag the United States into a conflict with Iran while American forces are already stretched thin, especially with Trump authorizing a minor troop surge in Afghanistan, stated a senior administration official. A former U.S. official noted that Hezbollah and Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq have been instrumental in reclaiming large portions of the territory that the Islamic State captured in Syria and Iraq back in 2014. U.S. troops supporting Kurdish and Sunni Arab fighters against the Islamic State in Syria have been grappling with how to respond to aggressive actions by Iranian-backed forces. In notable incidents, U.S. aircraft downed two Iranian-made drones in June, justified as defensive measures tailored to halt an imminent threat on the ground. Trump's opposition to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), poses a quandary for policymakers. Most of his national security advisers, as well as U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, prefer remaining in the agreement despite their concerns about Iran's compliance, according to U.S. officials engaged in the discussions. \"Our primary focus was to persuade the president not to discard the JCPOA. However, he and (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) Nikki Haley were adamant about adopting a tougher stance against Iran,\" one of the U.S. officials remarked. \"Almost all the strategies proposed were geared towards upholding the JCPOA while being proactive on these other matters.\""}

Nechirvan Barzani, who has served alongside his uncle as prime minister, will now be the main authority figure in the executive of the Kurdish autonomous region, following Masoud Barzani s departure as president, Kurdish officials said.  The prime minister will be the key person during this transitional period,  said Hoshyar Zebari, a former Iraqi foreign minister, now advisor to the Kurdish government and senior member of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).  The elder Barzani, a 71-year-old veteran guerrilla leader, had run the Kurdish autonomous region with a firm hand since 2005, during which it prospered while the rest of Iraq was mired in civil war. But he announced his resignation on Sunday, effective on Nov. 1, after a Sept. 25 referendum on independence backfired, prompting the central government to send troops to recapture territory held by the Kurds outside their autonomous region. The referendum and government backlash have also revealed deep divisions among the Kurds themselves. During his resignation speech, Masoud Barzani accused his political rivals of  high treason  for yielding territory without a fight. His nephew Nechirvan, 51, who has served as prime minister for all but three years since 2006, is seen in Kurdish politics as a less polarising figure, having warmer relations than his uncle with rival Kurdish parties. He also has a close working relationship with Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan, who has backed Baghdad in the central government s dispute with the Kurds since the referendum. The Kurdish regional parliament voted on Sunday to divide the president s powers among parliament, the judiciary and the cabinet, until parliamentary and presidential elections are next held. The elections were originally scheduled for Nov. 1 but postponed last month until next year. Before the referendum, Barzani s son Masrour was seen as his likely successor, but he has been damaged by his backing of the secession vote, which soured relationships with Baghdad and regional powers who opposed it. On Monday, the United States commended Masoud Barzani for stepping down and said it would actively engage with Nechirvan Barzani and his deputy, Qubad Talabani, a member of the rival political faction with whom he maintains a good relationship.

In his televised address on Sunday announcing the end of his presidency, Barzani said that he would remain a Peshmerga, or Kurdish fighter, and will continue to battle for his people s lifelong dream of independence. He will also remain head of the ruling party and will still sit on the High Political Council, a non-governmental body which emerged after the referendum. Kurdish politics have been dominated for decades by the KDP, led by three generations of the Barzani family, and its main rivals the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), led by the family of Jalal Talabani, who died in October.

The Western-backed coalition, which controls Yemen s airspace and port access, said last month it would allow humanitarian relief through Hodeidah following a nearly three-week blockade imposed because of a missile attack toward the Saudi capital s international airport. The Saudis say the Red Sea port, which is Yemen s main entry point for food and humanitarian supplies, is also a hub used by the Houthis to bring in weapons, which it accuses Iran of supplying. Tehran denies the charges. On Wednesday, the coalition confirmed it would keep access open to the port despite another missile attack at Riyadh on Tuesday by the Houthis which Saudi forces also intercepted.   Keen to maintain humanitarian aid to the brotherly Yemeni people and as a result of intensified inspection measures, the coalition command announces that Hodeidah port will remain open for humanitarian and relief supplies,  the coalition said in a statement carried by Saudi state news agency SPA on Wednesday. The Saudi ambassador to Sanaa said the coalition would also allow the provision of four cranes to the port to boost aid deliveries to the war-damaged country. The ambassador, Mohammed al-Jaber, who was speaking in a televised news conference, did not give details on how the cranes would be delivered.  Earlier this year, the United Nations said the coalition turned back four cranes the United States donated to the World Food Programme to boost aid operations at Hodeidah.  The cranes would have replaced parts of the port s infrastructure destroyed by coalition air strikes in August 2015, damage that forced ships to line up offshore because they could not be unloaded. The coalition said ships bringing in fuel and food would also be allowed to enter for another 30 days while proposals made by the United Nations envoy to Yemen were implemented, it added. The agency did not elaborate on the proposals. But the coalition has been demanding that a U.N. inspection regime agreed in 2015 be further tightened to prevent weapons from reaching the Houthis.

Tuesday s missile attack took place as the Houthis marked 1,000 days since the coalition intervened in the Yemen war in March 2015 to try to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after a Houthi advance on his base in Aden forced him to flee. Saudi Arabia said that since the war began the Houthis had fired 83 ballistic missiles toward the kingdom.

On Monday, eight women and two children from the same family died when war planes struck a vehicle returning from a wedding party in Marib, east of Sanaa. ", "predictions": "ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition engaged in the conflict in Yemen declared on Wednesday that it would leave the Houthi-held Hodeidah port, crucial for humanitarian aid, open for a period of one month despite a recent missile attack directed at Riyadh. Although continuing air raids led to the deaths of at least nine individuals, the coalition remains committed to keeping the port operational. The alliance, backed by Western powers and in control of Yemen's airspace and port access, had previously announced that humanitarian relief shipments would be permitted through Hodeidah after a near three-week blockade imposed due to a missile strike aimed at Riyadh's international airport. The Saudis have alleged that the Red Sea port, serving as Yemen's primary gateway for food and aid supplies, is utilized by the Houthis for importing weaponry, which they claim Iran is supplying. Tehran has denied these accusations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the coalition affirmed that access to the port would be maintained despite another missile attack on Riyadh by the Houthis, which was intercepted by Saudi forces. In a statement released by the Saudi state news agency SPA, the coalition emphasized its commitment to ensuring the flow of humanitarian and relief supplies through Hodeidah port. Additionally, the Saudi ambassador to Sanaa announced that the coalition would facilitate the provision of four cranes to enhance aid deliveries to the war-ravaged country. However, details regarding the delivery of these cranes were not disclosed during the ambassador's televised news conference.\n\nEarlier this year, the United Nations reported that the coalition had turned away four cranes donated by the United States to the World Food Programme, aimed at bolstering aid operations at Hodeidah. The coalition indicated that fuel and food vessels would also be permitted entry for a further 30 days, contingent on the implementation of proposals put forth by the UN envoy to Yemen, without specifying these proposals. The coalition has been pushing for stricter enforcement of a 2015 UN inspection regime to prevent weapons from reaching the Houthis.\n\nA telephone call between King Salman and U.S. President Donald Trump, as reported by Saudi state news agency SPA, discussed strategies to hold Iran accountable for its actions and involvement in supplying missiles to the Houthi militia, threatening the security of the region. The call was later confirmed by the White House, emphasizing the necessity of revitalizing a political process to end the conflict in Yemen. The leaders also discussed a Saudi plan to address the humanitarian crisis arising from the conflict.\n\nAs the conflict marks 1,000 days since the coalition's intervention in Yemen, tensions persist with continuous missile attacks and airstrikes. The toll of the war includes more than 10,000 fatalities, intensifying the humanitarian crisis. Coalition forces, supported by the U.S. and Britain, recently conducted fresh airstrikes resulting in civilian casualties, including a tragic incident where members of the same family lost their lives. Despite denying the intentional targeting of civilians, the coalition faces recurrent criticism for airstrikes causing civilian casualties in Yemen."}

The leader of the Roman Catholic church will also visit Bangladesh, where more than 620,000 Rohingya have fled to escape what Amnesty International has called  crimes against humanity . Myanmar s army has denied accusations of murder, rape, torture and forced displacement that have been made against it. The pope s first meeting in Yangon was with military commander Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in St. Mary s Cathedral in the heart of the Southeast Asian nation s largest city.  They discussed the great responsibility of authorities of the country in this time of transition,  Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said after the 15 minutes of talks, which were followed by an exchange of gifts. Francis presented the general with a commemorative medal of his visit, and Min Aung Hlaing gave the pope a harp in the shape of a boat and an ornate rice bowl, Burke said. The army chief told the pope that  there s no religious discrimination in Myanmar and there s the freedom of religion,  according to a statement on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.  Every soldier s goal is to build a stable and peaceful country,  the army chief was paraphrased as saying in the statement.

Only about 700,000 of Myanmar s 51 million people are Roman Catholic. Thousands of them traveled by train and bus to Yangon, and they joined crowds at several roadside points along the way from the airport to catch a glimpse of the pope.

He is very knowledgeable when it comes to political affairs. He will handle the issue smartly,  he said, referring to the sensitivity of the pope s discussions about the Rohingya. Large numbers of riot police were mobilized in Yangon but there were no signs of any protests. The trip is so delicate that some papal advisers have warned Francis against even saying the word  Rohingya , lest he set off a diplomatic incident that could turn the country s military and government against minority Christians. The Rohingya exodus from Rakhine state to Bangladesh s southern tip began at the end of August, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week called the military operation  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions for  horrendous atrocities . Myanmar s government has denied most of the accusations made against it, and the army says its own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens nor as members of a distinct ethnic group with their own identity, and it even rejects the term  Rohingya  and its use. Many people in Myanmar instead refer to members of the Muslim minority in Rakhine state as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.  Francis is expected to meet a group of Rohingya refugees in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, on the second leg of his trip. The most tense moments of his Myanmar visit were expected to be the private meeting with the army chief and, separately, with civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday. Vatican sources say some in the Holy See believe the trip was decided too hastily after full diplomatic ties were established in May during a visit by Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi s reputation as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been tarnished because she has expressed doubts about the reports of rights abuses against the Rohingya and failed to condemn the military.

From this perspective , the natural state space of a boson might seem to be a non @-@ separable space . However , it is only a small separable subspace of the full tensor product that can contain physically meaningful fields ( on which the observables can be defined ) . Another non @-@ separable Hilbert space models the state of an infinite collection of particles in an unbounded region of space . An orthonormal basis of the space is indexed by the density of the particles , a continuous parameter , and since the set of possible densities is uncountable , the basis is not countable .\n\n= = Orthogonal complements and projections = =\n\nIf S is a subset of a Hilbert space H , the set of vectors orthogonal to S is defined by\n<formula>\nS â¥ is a closed subspace of H ( can be proved easily using the linearity and continuity of the inner product ) and so forms itself a Hilbert space . If V is a closed subspace of H , then V â¥ is called the orthogonal complement of V. In fact , every x in H can then be written uniquely as x\n= v + w , with v in V and w in V â¥ . Therefore , H is the internal Hilbert direct sum of V and V â¥ .\nThe linear operator PV : H â H that maps x to v is called the orthogonal projection onto V. There is a natural one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence between the set of all closed subspaces of H and the set of all bounded self @-@ adjoint operators P such that P2 =\nP. Specifically ,\nTheorem . The orthogonal projection PV is a self @-@ adjoint linear operator on H of norm â¤ 1 with the property P2V", "predictions": "Rewrite:\nFor every k = 1 to n, it can be deduced that x subtract y is perpendicular to each fk, hence x subtract y is perpendicular to y. By utilizing the Pythagorean identity twice, it can be concluded that\n<formula>\nTake an arbitrary orthonormal system { fi }, i belonging to I, in H. When the above inequality is applied to every finite subset J of I, it results in the Bessel inequality\n<formula>\n(according to the definition of the sum of a collection of non-negative real numbers).\nFrom a geometric perspective, Bessel's inequality indicates that the orthogonal projection of x onto the linear subspace spanned by the fi has a norm that is not greater than that of x. In a two-dimensional context, this means that the length of the leg of a right triangle must not exceed the length of the hypotenuse.\nBessel's inequality serves as a foundation for the more potent Parseval identity, which governs situations where Bessel's inequality turns out to be an equality. If { ek } k belonging to B forms an orthonormal basis of H, then any element x of H can be represented as\n<formula>\nEven in the case of B being uncountable, Bessel's inequality ensures that the expression is well-defined and comprises only a countable number of non-zero terms. This summation is referred to as the Fourier expansion of x, with the coefficients âŸ¨ x, ek âŸ© being the Fourier coefficients of x. Subsequently, Parseval's formula can be expressed as\n<formula>\nConversely, if { ek } is an orthonormal set such that Parseval's identity holds for all x, then { ek } represents an orthonormal basis.\n\nHilbert dimension:\n\nAs a consequence of Zorn's lemma, each Hilbert space possesses an orthonormal basis; furthermore, any two orthonormal bases of the same space share the same cardinality, known as the Hilbert dimension of the space. For instance, since â„“2(B) has an orthonormal basis indexed by B, its Hilbert dimension aligns with the cardinality of B, which could be a finite integer or a countable or uncountable cardinal number.\nThrough Parseval's identity, if { ek } k belonging to B constitutes an orthonormal basis of H, then the mapping Î¦: H â†’ â„“2(B) defined as Î¦(x) = (âŸ¨ x, ek âŸ©) k belonging to B is an isometric isomorphism of Hilbert spaces: a bijective linear mapping that satisfies\n<formula>\nfor every x and y in H. The cardinality of B signifies the Hilbert dimension of H, implying that each Hilbert space can be isometrically isomorphic to a sequence space â„“2(B) associated with a specific set B.\n\nSeparable spaces:\n\nA Hilbert space is considered separable if and only if it possesses a countable orthonormal basis. Therefore, all infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are isometrically analogous to â„“2.\nHistorically, it was common for Hilbert spaces to be required to be separable as part of their definition. The majority of spaces utilized in physics are separable, and since these spaces are isomorphic, any infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space is typically referred to as \"the Hilbert space\" or simply \"Hilbert space.\" Even within quantum field theory, the majority of Hilbert spaces are separable, as specified by the Wightman axioms. Nonetheless, arguments are made in favor of the significance of non-separable Hilbert spaces in quantum field theory due to the infinite degrees of freedom within the systems, rendering any infinite Hilbert tensor product (of dimensions exceeding one) non-separable. For instance, a bosonic field can be viewed as part of a tensor product representing harmonic oscillators at each spatial point, where the natural state space may appear as non-separable. However, only a compact separable subspace of the full tensor product can harbor physically meaningful fields (where observables can be defined). Another non-separable Hilbert space models the state of an endless assembly of particles in an unbounded spatial region, with the basis indexed by the particle density, a continuous parameter, resulting in an uncountable set of possible densities and hence, a non-countable basis.\n\nOrthogonal complements and projections:\n\nGiven a subset S within a Hilbert space H, the set of vectors orthogonal to S is defined as\n<formula>\nS ⊥ forms a closed subspace of H, establishing itself as a Hilbert space. If V is a closed subspace of H, then V ⊥ is referred to as the orthogonal complement of V. Essentially, every x in H can be uniquely represented as x = v + w, where v is from V and w is from V ⊥. Thus, H can be considered as the internal Hilbert direct sum of V and V ⊥. The linear operator PV: H → H, which maps x to v, is known as the orthogonal projection onto V. A direct one-to-one correspondence exists between the set of all closed subspaces of H and the collection of bounded self-adjoint operators P such that P2 = P. Specifically,\nTheorem. The orthogonal projection PV is a self-adjoint linear operator on H with a norm ≤ 1 and the property P2V"}

Simek proposes that Hlín is likely just another name for Frigg, and suggests that Snorri misinterpreted her as a separate goddess in his analysis of the Völuspá stanza.\nHowever, Rudolf Simek also mentions in the same context that goddesses like Sága, Hlín, Sjöfn, Snotra, Vár, and Vör should be viewed as vaguely defined entities who serve as \"female protective goddesses,\" each responsible for distinct areas within the private sphere, resembling matrons in many ways. John Lindow points out that if Hlín is indeed Frigg, then this implies that Hlín's \"second sorrow\" in Völuspá pertains to the death of Odin, with the first being the demise of Baldr."}

This star, which is approximately 1.5 times more massive than the Sun and over twice its size, was notable for being the largest star discovered with a transiting planet in its orbit when it was first observed. The discovery of the planet Kepler-40b orbiting Kepler-40 was made possible by data from the Kepler spacecraft and later confirmed by a team of scientists from France and Switzerland, with their findings being published in a scientific journal on January 4, 2011.\n\nInitially pinpointed as a potential transit event by the Kepler spacecraft, Kepler-40 was designated as a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) during the satellite's early operations in 2009. Further analysis by French and Swiss astronomers, including the use of the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph, led to the confirmation of the exoplanet Kepler-40b. Subsequent research focused on studying the characteristics of Kepler-40, revealing it as a star larger and more evolved than most known to host a transiting planet at the time.\n\nCharacterized as an F-type star with a mass 1.48 times that of the Sun and a radius 2.13 times larger, Kepler-40 boasts an effective temperature of 6510 K, indicating it is hotter than the Sun. With a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.10, it contains 1.26 times more iron than the Sun. Kepler-40's unique features place it as a significant host star for the exoplanet Kepler-40b, which has a mass equivalent to 2.2 Jupiters and a radius 1.17 times that of Jupiter. Kepler-40b's characteristics, including its density and orbital details, distinguish it as an intriguing exoplanet within the system.\n\nLocated 2700 parsecs (8,806.4 light years) away from Earth, Kepler-40 stands as one of the furthest stars with a known exoplanet discovered by Kepler, undetectable by the naked eye due to its low apparent magnitude. The planetary system of Kepler-40 is currently known to consist solely of Kepler-40b, an exciting discovery shedding light on the dynamics of exoplanetary systems in the universe."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Front-runner Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will have essentially sealed the Republican U.S. presidential nomination if he wins Tuesday’s contest in Indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival Ted Cruz. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist opinion poll showed Trump with a wide lead in Indiana, 49 percent to 34 percent for Cruz and 13 percent for a third candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, sounded confident in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” when asked whether Indiana would basically end the long-running Republican race in his favor. “Yes, it’s over,” Trump said. “It’s already over.” The poll showed the depth of the challenge facing Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas who is trying to prevent Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates needed to seal the nomination.  Cruz’s hopes rest on emerging as a consensus alternative to Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 18-21. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 68, leads U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, 74, of Vermont in the race for the Democratic nomination. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Cruz, 45, was asked several times whether he would support Trump if the New York businessman was the Republican nominee. Cruz evaded the question each time and turned the questions into an attack on broadcast media. “I recognize that many in the media would love to see me surrender to Donald Trump because that means that Hillary wins. The media has given $2 billion in free advertising to Donald Trump,” Cruz said. Cruz said he has momentum in Indiana based on his choice of former candidate Carly Fiorina for his vice president and Friday’s endorsement by Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Americans will elect a successor to President Barack Obama on Nov. 8. Trump, who has amassed 996 delegates, according to an Associated Press count, has momentum behind him and looks increasingly likely to win the nomination outright, without a contested convention, perhaps when California votes on June 7. Indiana has 57 Republican delegates. Three are awarded from each of the state’s nine U.S. congressional districts with the candidate who receives the most votes taking them all. The 30 others are awarded to the candidate who wins the most votes statewide. At a rally in Terre Haute, Indiana, Trump urged Republicans to join his “movement” and turn out for him in big numbers. “The more we can win by in Indiana is so important. It’s a mandate ... a really important mandate. It’s a mandate for change, but not Obama change. Real change. It’s a mandate for genius,” he said. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a leading Republican critic of Trump, called him the “most unelectable person” the party could nominate. Graham had sought the nomination himself. “Keep fighting Ted,” Graham told CBS’s “Face the Nation.” On the Democratic side, front-runner Clinton told CNN’s “State of the Union” that rival Bernie Sanders has been “helpful” in bringing millions of people into the party’s presidential race, but it was time for him to step aside. “There comes a time when you have to look at the reality,” said Clinton, who won four of the five Northeastern states that voted last Tuesday and who has a big lead in the delegate race ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 25-28. But at a news conference in Washington, Sanders refused to get out, saying he believes the Democratic battle will end up in a contested convention. Sanders said it was nearly impossible for Clinton to win the 2,383 delegates needed for nomination without superdelegates, who are unelected and free to support any candidate they wish. “We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining,” he said. Clinton has 2,165 to Sanders’ 1,357 delegates, according to an AP count that includes superdelegates who have said whom they support.

Trump, a wealthy real estate mogul at the age of 69, expressed confidence during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" confidently stating that Indiana could effectively bring an end to the lengthy Republican race in his favor. The poll underscored the considerable challenge facing Cruz, a conservative senator from Texas, who is aiming to prevent Trump from reaching the required 1,237 delegates for nomination. Cruz's strategy hinges on positioning himself as a viable alternative to Trump at the upcoming Republican National Convention in July. Meanwhile, in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders, with Cruz evading questions about supporting Trump if he becomes the nominee, redirecting the focus to criticize the media's coverage. Despite the pressure, Cruz remains optimistic due to his recent endorsements and strategic moves. Trump, nearing the required delegate count, appears increasingly likely to secure the nomination outright, potentially before the California primary in June. Indiana holds significance with its 57 Republican delegates, distributed based on the votes in congressional districts and statewide. Trump, speaking at a rally in Terre Haute, Indiana, urged Republicans to unite behind his campaign for substantial change.

The quotients qk are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio ( such as the complex number Î± / Î² ) to the nearest integers . The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be \" smaller \" than another .

The final nonzero remainder is the gcd ( Î± , Î² ) , the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both Î± and Î² ; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit , Â± 1 or Â± i .\nMany of the other applications of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers .

These operations need not align with basic arithmetic; they may follow different mathematical structures but should adhere to fundamental arithmetic laws. The process involves a Euclidean function, denoted as f, mapping elements in R to nonnegative integers. For any nonzero a and b in R, there must exist q and r such that a = qb + r with f(r) < f(b). The reduction of f at each step guarantees the algorithm's finite termination. The crucial application of the natural well-ordering of non-negative integers ensures a smallest member in any non-empty set, enabling the principle of inexorable reduction. \nEuclidean domains adhere to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, ensuring unique factorization of elements into irreducible components. While Euclidean domains are Unique Factorization Domains (UFDs), the reverse is not always true. They are subsets of GCD domains where a greatest common divisor is guaranteed. A Euclidean domain always qualifies as a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), where every ideal is principal. However, not all PIDs are Euclidean domains. The unique factorization property of Euclidean domains is particularly advantageous, exemplified by Gaussian integers' case in deriving Pythagorean triple formulas and proving Fermat's theorem. This uniqueness was central in a 1847 attempted proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Gabriel Lamé, alongside the analysis of Euclid's algorithm. Lamé aimed to factor numbers of the form x + ωy, where ω = e^(2iπ/n), showcasing its significance. Nonetheless, unique factorization challenges in cyclotomic fields propelled Kummer and Dedekind towards ideal numbers. \nQuadratic integers exemplify Euclidean domains, extending the concept to rings where the imaginary unit i is replaced with ω. The form u + vω accommodates two variations depending on parameter D. Norm-Euclidean rings of quadratic integers conform to a norm function, akin to the Gaussian integers' ordering mechanism."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As she waits for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law, Amy Hagstrom-Miller said she hopes she will not have to close up to three of the clinics she operates in the state, but is planning for it just in case.     Hagstrom-Miller founded Whole Woman’s Health, which runs four facilities in Texas that provide abortions and led the legal challenge to the law. She said she has spreadsheets listing staffers who would be laid off if the court allows the law to survive, and is thinking about selling buildings and medical equipment as well as shutting her clinics in Fort Worth, San Antonio and McAllen.     “I would be irresponsible if I didn’t plan,” Hagstrom-Miller said in an interview. The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on whether the Texas law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman’s constitutional right to end her pregnancy as set out in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The court has not issued a major abortion-related ruling since 2007.     The law requires abortion doctors to have “admitting privileges,” a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. That provision has been implemented. A second provision, not yet in effect, requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities including extensive standards for such attributes as corridor width, room size, floor tiles and the swinging motion of doors. Supporters of the law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013, say it was enacted to protect women’s health.     Abortion rights advocates say it imposes medically unnecessary regulations intended to shut clinics and has dramatically reduced access to abortion in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people. Getting a clear-cut ruling is complicated by the fact that the court is down to eight justices, split evenly with four conservatives and four liberals, following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia. One possibility is a 4-4 split that would affirm a lower court’s decision upholding the law but would not set a national legal precedent that could guide other states eager to pass similar statutes. Because it is unlikely one of the court’s liberals would join the four conservatives, there is almost no chance of a  broad ruling upholding the law and giving other states a green light to enact similar measures. Numerous Republican-governed states have considered measures that would restrict abortion availability. For abortion opponents, who no longer have Scalia to cast a fifth vote to tip the balance in their favor, a 4-4 split leaving the Texas law in place may be the best result possible. John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in California, an abortion opponent who filed a brief with the high court backing the Texas law, said if the justices cannot deliver a decisive ruling, “It’s not a catastrophe.” “I’d rather have women’s health and safety in some parts of the country than no parts of the country,” Eastman said. Legal fights over similar laws are ongoing in several states, including Mississippi, Louisiana and Wisconsin.     If the court leaves in place the lower-court ruling upholding the Texas law, the number of abortion clinics in the state would drop from the current 19 to nine, abortion providers said. Texas had 41 abortion clinics when the law was passed.     “A 4-4 decision would leave us in the untenable situation where a woman’s ability to get an abortion will depend on where she lives,” said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes restrictive abortion laws.      Another possibility is that the justices strike down the law, or invalidate one of the two provisions at issue while keeping the other. It may be more likely that the admitting-privileges provision, already in effect, would survive, while the hospital-grade facilities requirements, which the justices themselves temporarily blocked, would not. Justice Anthony Kennedy could be the key player in any such scenarios, which would require at least one conservative to join the four liberals.

The Supreme Court is expected to deliver its verdict on the Texas law by the end of June, assessing its impact on a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, as established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The law enforces strict regulations on abortion providers and facilities, including the requirement for doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and costly hospital-grade facility standards. Supporters argue that the law safeguards women's health, while opponents claim it imposes unnecessary restrictions leading to a significant reduction in abortion accessibility in Texas. With the court currently divided and the absence of a deciding fifth vote, potential outcomes include a 4-4 split upholding the law without setting a national precedent, or the justices striking down all or part of the law. The uncertainty surrounding the ruling has sparked concerns and implications for abortion providers and women seeking abortion services in Texas."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump set the tone for a tense first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week by tweeting on Thursday that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses.  The White House said Trump would host Xi next Thursday and Friday at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. It said Trump and his wife, Melania, would host Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a dinner next Thursday. In a tweet on Thursday evening, Trump said the highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies, which is also expected to cover differences over North Korea and China’s strategic ambitions in the South China Sea, “will be a very difficult one.” “We can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses,” he wrote, adding in apparent reference to U.S. firms manufacturing in China: “American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.” Despite a string of U.S.-China meetings and conversations that have appeared aimed at mending ties after strong criticism of China by Trump during his election campaign, U.S. officials have said the Republican president will not pull his punches in the meeting.     General Electric Co Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt urged Trump on Thursday to maintain the country’s economic relationship with China, saying the United States had much to gain from globalization. “The country loses if we don’t trade. The relationship with China is key,” Immelt told an aviation panel hosted by industry group the Wings Club. “If you give up on trade, you give up on the best lever that the president of the United States has in negotiating around the world. I just think that President Trump is too smart to give up on that.” The U.S. Commerce Department said earlier that Beijing must change its trade practices and the way its state enterprises operate. “China and others need to realize the games are over – continuing their unfair trade practices and operation as a non-market economy will have serious consequences,” it said. The department said it was launching a new review of China’s status as a non-market economy, which allows the United States  to maintain high anti-dumping duties on cheap Chinese imports, but the designation is widely expected to remain in place.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang stressed the need to see the big picture while fostering mutual trade interests. “The market dictates that interests between our two countries are structured so that you will always have me and I will always have you,” he told a regular briefing. “Both sides should work together to make the cake of mutual interest bigger and not simply seek fairer distribution.” Trump administration officials say the need for China to do more to rein in the nuclear and missile programs of its neighbor and ally North Korea will top the agenda, along with trade. The U.S. side is also expected to criticize Beijing for its pursuit of expansive claims in the South China Sea. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing the meeting would be an opportunity for Trump “to develop a relationship in person with President Xi.” “He’s spoken to him on the phone a few times, but we have big problems ... everything from the South China Sea, to trade, to North Korea. There are big issues of national and economic security that need to get addressed.” Asked if the administration had a vision, or a description for its China policy like the “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia touted by former President Barack Obama, Spicer said: “Right now we’re not worried so much about slogans as much as progress. “There’s a lot of big things that we need to accomplish with China, and I think that we will - we will work on them.” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson agreed in Beijing this month to work with China on North Korea and stressed Trump’s desire to enhance understanding.  China has been irritated at being told repeatedly by Washington to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, or face U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses trading with North Korea, and by the U.S. decision to base an advanced missile defense system in South Korea. Beijing is also deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions toward self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, after Trump, as president-elect, broke with decades of U.S. policy by taking a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and saying Washington did not have to stick to a “one China” policy.

{"src_passage": " PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Tom Westerman voted for Donald Trump in last year’s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies.  “It really upset me,” said Westerman, 63, a self-described “middle-class guy” with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.  Westerman’s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.  Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.  Some insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obama’s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.  “It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,” said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.  Westerman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughter’s college tuition. “He says he’s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?”  A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump has called subsidy payments a “gift” for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.  Some people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.  “I support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,” said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.  “Forget the president – it’s the Congress’s responsibility. They’re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,” Heuring said.  In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.  On Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.  Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trump’s cutoff is settled in court.  The moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.  MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE  If the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  These include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.  Karyn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.  Feit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among America’s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.  Her current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trump’s decision.  “The first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,” said Feit, a Democrat.  Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.  “It is a concern obviously,” Lewis said.

Westerman, a 63-year-old resident of Arnold, Pennsylvania, with a yearly income of approximately $60,000, stated that this move by Trump troubled him deeply. His reaction mirrors the growing anxiety among middle-class individuals from both Democratic and Republican backgrounds regarding potential spikes in their health insurance expenses due to Trump's actions against the healthcare law established by former President Barack Obama. Trump recently declared the cessation of monthly subsidies, labeling them as a bailout for insurers. These funds reimburse insurers for providing discounts on deductibles, copays, and other expenses to low-income households under Obamacare. Some insurers had already increased 2018 premiums in anticipation of Trump cutting off the funding, leading to market withdrawals in various states. Westerman, a retired worker from Pennsylvania, criticized Trump's approach, feeling that it targets the middle class adversely, especially considering his existing expenses on healthcare and his daughter's college tuition.\n\nFor inquiries about the matter, the White House spokesperson deferred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not respond immediately. Trump and his administration view the subsidies as undue support for insurance companies, arguing that they lack the legal authority to continue payments without congressional approval. While some individuals applaud Trump for fulfilling his promise to dismantle Obamacare, others like Roger Heuring from New Jersey point fingers at Congress for the mess created by the healthcare law. In response to cutting subsidies, Trump also signed an executive order aimed at enabling Americans to buy more affordable health insurance plans than those mandated by Obamacare. As discussions unfold, there is uncertainty surrounding the future of Obamacare subsidies just before the enrollment period for 2018 plans begins. Larry Levitt from the Kaiser Family Foundation warns that if the subsidies are not reinstated, middle-income families and small business owners relying on Obamacare markets could face significant premium increases, affecting those who earn too much for government assistance but depend on Obamacare for insurance coverage.\n\nIndividuals like Karyn Feit, a self-employed therapist in Philadelphia, anticipate financial strain from potential premium hikes, which could compel them to cut back on essential expenses. Despite facing concerns about rising premiums, some individuals like Stephen Lewis from Wisconsin, who purchased an Obamacare insurance plan after losing his job, continue to support Trump. Lewis fears that his current premiums of $309 per month might further rise due to the subsidy cuts, posing challenges in meeting other financial obligations."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday seized on the deadly New York City truck attack to step up demands for stricter U.S. immigration laws, asking Congress to end a visa program that let the Uzbek suspect into the country and saying he might send him to Guantanamo Bay. In a day of harsh recriminations over Tuesday’s attack that killed eight people in America’s largest city, Trump appeared to assign some blame for an incident that authorities have labeled as terrorism to top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, who accused Trump of politicizing a national tragedy.  Trump said he would consider sending the suspect, identified by authorities as Sayfullo Saipov, to the military prison at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama tried but failed to shut. No detainee has been sent to the Guantanamo prison since 2008. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters that Trump considers Saipov an “enemy combatant,” a designation that would curtail his legal rights. Trump called the suspect “this animal” and lambasted the U.S. justice system for terrorism suspects as “a joke” and “a laughingstock.” Since taking office in January, Trump has sought to increase deportations of illegal immigrations and limit legal immigration. The Department of Homeland Security said Saipov entered the United States in 2010 through the so-called diversity visa program, designed to provide a path to U.S. residency for citizens from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States. Authorities said Saipov drove a rented truck along a bike path in lower Manhattan, mowing down cyclists and pedestrians. Police shot and wounded Saipov before arresting him. Trump reprised what has been his stance as a White House candidate and as president - that tougher immigration laws should be a first line of defense against such attacks. “I’m going to ask Congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program,” Trump told reporters at the White House.  “We have to get much tougher,” he said. “We have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct. We’re so politically correct that we’re afraid to do anything.” Schumer helped create the diversity visa program in 1990 when he in the House of Representatives, but he was also part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who crafted an immigration bill in 2013 that would have done away with the program. That bill was passed by the Senate but killed by the Republican-led House. The program, via a lottery, selects up to 50,000 people per year who receive U.S. visas, and eventually permanent residence in the United States. Those selected undergo U.S. security checks before being allowed to immigrate. “The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,” Trump wrote on Twitter. Sanders said later that Trump does not blame Schumer for the attack and would “love” to work with the senator on tougher immigration laws. Trump on Wednesday also renewed his call for a “merit-based” visa system - which would favor the highly skilled - and for ending “chain migration,” which allows legal immigrants to apply for relatives abroad to come to the United States. Trump said there were “23 people that came in or potentially came in” with Saipov. Asked if legislation to end the visa program would be taken up, No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn told reporters that Congress must first pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought into the country as children, “and then the next thing we need to do is turn to our legal immigration system and see how we can change it.” Trump accused congressional Democrats of blocking immigration legislation that would make the nation safer. “We have a lot of good bills in there. We’re being stopped by Democrats because they’re obstructionists. And honestly, they don’t want to do what’s right for our country,” Trump said. Both the Senate and the House are controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the Trump administration for not declaring Saipov, who remained hospitalized after being shot in the abdomen by a police officer on Tuesday, as an “enemy combatant.” “It’s ridiculous to believe that one day of interviews in a hospital tells us all we need to know about Saipov’s terrorist ties,” Graham said in a statement. The complaint filed against Saipov said he had waived his rights and agreed to speak to investigators without an attorney present. As a presidential candidate, Trump called for a total ban on Muslims entering the country as a counter-terrorism measure. Courts have blocked his latest executive action barring entry into the United States by people from several Muslim-majority countries. Sanders said the White House has not ruled out adding Uzbekistan to the list of countries named in the travel ban.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Israel  faced repeated heckling at a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday before he apologized for his stinging criticism of liberal American Jews and promised to be less inflammatory in an official capacity. David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer Trump has called a longtime friend and trusted adviser, has supported Jewish settlement building and advocated the annexation of the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war. His nomination has been fiercely opposed by some American Jewish groups. Friedman repeatedly expressed regret for likening liberal American Jews to Jewish prisoners who worked for the Nazis during the Holocaust, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his opening statement, “I regret the use of such language.” Trump is following through on a promised shift in U.S. policy toward Israel after years of friction between former President Barack Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Flanked by Netanyahu at a White House news conference, Trump on Wednesday dropped a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of its Middle East policy, even as he urged Netanyahu to curb settlement construction. The heated opposition to Friedman’s nomination erupted in the hearing room as Friedman began his opening statement, with several hecklers including a man who held up the Palestinian flag and shouted about Palestinian claims to the land of Israel. “My grandfather was exiled,” the man said before being escorted out of the room. “Palestinians will always be in Palestine!” Democratic senators pressed Friedman on incendiary comments he made including calling Obama an anti-Semite and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, an appeaser. “Frankly the language you have regularly used against those who disagree with your views has me concerned about your preparedness to enter the world of diplomacy,” Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the committee, told the nominee. Friedman acknowledged using overheated rhetoric as part of his passionate support for the Jewish state, which has included financial support of Jewish settlements built on land claimed by Palestinians. He promised to avoid inflammatory comments as a U.S. diplomat. He told Cardin, “There is no excuse. If you want me to rationalize it or justify it, I cannot. These were hurtful words and I deeply regret them.” Cardin, citing Friedman’s criticism of Schumer as having done the “worst appeasement of terrorists since Munich,” retorted that those words were “beyond hurtful.”  “We need a steady hand in the Middle East, not a bomb thrower,” admonished Tom Udall, another Democrat. Under questioning, Friedman tried to soften his positions on a number of hot-button regional issues.  While expressing skepticism of a two-state solution calling for the creation of Palestinian state next to Israel, he acknowledged it was the best option for peace. He said he did not personally support Israeli annexation of the West Bank and agreed with Trump’s view that settlement activity “may not be helpful” to achieving peace. “You’re here today having to recant every single strongly held belief that you’ve expressed, almost,” the committee’s Republican chairman, Bob Corker, noted. Friedman is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged that Friedman has said things he did not agree with but backed the nominee as qualified, experienced and passionate. “I believe he is the right guy at the right time. He’ll be Trump’s voice. Trump won the election,” Graham said.

David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer Trump has called a longtime friend and trusted adviser, has supported Jewish settlement building and advocated the annexation of the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war. His nomination has been fiercely opposed by some American Jewish groups. Friedman repeatedly expressed regret for likening liberal American Jews to Jewish prisoners who worked for the Nazis during the Holocaust, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his opening statement, “I regret the use of such language.” Trump is following through on a promised shift in U.S. policy toward Israel after years of friction between former President Barack Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Flanked by Netanyahu at a White House news conference, Trump on Wednesday dropped a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of its Middle East policy, even as he urged Netanyahu to curb settlement construction. The heated opposition to Friedman’s nomination erupted in the hearing room as Friedman began his opening statement, with several hecklers including a man who held up the Palestinian flag and shouted about Palestinian claims to the land of Israel. “My grandfather was exiled,” the man said before being escorted out of the room. “Palestinians will always be in Palestine!” Democratic senators pressed Friedman on incendiary comments he made including calling Obama an anti-Semite and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, an appeaser. “Frankly the language you have regularly used against those who disagree with your views has me concerned about your preparedness to enter the world of diplomacy,” Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the committee, told the nominee. Friedman acknowledged using overheated rhetoric as part of his passionate support for the Jewish state, which has included financial support of Jewish settlements built on land claimed by Palestinians. He promised to avoid inflammatory comments as a U.S. diplomat. He told Cardin, “There is no excuse. If you want me to rationalize it or justify it, I cannot. These were hurtful words and I deeply regret them.” Cardin, citing Friedman’s criticism of Schumer as having done the “worst appeasement of terrorists since Munich,” retorted that those words were “beyond hurtful.”  “We need a steady hand in the Middle East, not a bomb thrower,” admonished Tom Udall, another Democrat. Under questioning, Friedman tried to soften his positions on a number of hot-button regional issues.  While expressing skepticism of a two-state solution calling for the creation of Palestinian state next to Israel, he acknowledged it was the best option for peace. He said he did not personally support Israeli annexation of the West Bank and agreed with Trump’s view that settlement activity “may not be helpful” to achieving peace. “You’re here today having to recant every single strongly held belief that you’ve expressed, almost,” the committee’s Republican chairman, Bob Corker, noted. Friedman is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged that Friedman has said things he did not agree with but backed the nominee as qualified, experienced and passionate. “I believe he is the right guy at the right time. He’ll be Trump’s voice. Trump won the election,” Graham said.  Five former U.S. ambassadors to Israel from both Republican and Democratic administrations urged the Senate in a letter to reject Friedman, saying that he holds “extreme, radical positions” on issues such as Jewish settlements and the two-state solution. “We believe him to be unqualified for the position,” wrote the former ambassadors including Thomas Pickering, Edward Walker, Daniel Kurtzer, James Cunningham and William Harrop.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel encountered disruptive behavior during a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday, where he addressed his prior contentious remarks about liberal American Jews and assured a more diplomatic approach if confirmed. David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer and close ally of Trump, has shown support for Jewish settlement expansion and the annexation of the West Bank, seized by Israel in the 1967 war. His nomination has faced strong opposition from certain American Jewish organizations. Friedman expressed remorse for likening liberal American Jews to Jewish prisoners aiding Nazis during the Holocaust, stating to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, “I regret using that language.” Trump is upholding his commitment to changing U.S. policy towards Israel after past tensions between former President Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Standing alongside Netanyahu in a White House press briefing, Trump recently abandoned U.S. backing for a two-state solution, a longstanding cornerstone of Middle East policy, while also urging a halt to settlement expansion. The confirmation hearing for Friedman saw vocal opposition, with hecklers, including one individual displaying the Palestinian flag and asserting Palestinian land rights. Amid the commotion, Friedman began his opening remarks. Democratic senators pressed him on controversial statements, such as labeling Obama an anti-Semite and calling Jewish Senate leader Chuck Schumer an appeaser. Concerns were raised about Friedman's readiness for diplomacy due to his combative language towards dissenters. Friedman admitted to using inflammatory rhetoric in his fervent backing of Israel, which included backing Jewish settlements on disputed territory. He pledged to adopt a more measured approach as a U.S. diplomat, acknowledging the hurt caused by his past words. Under questioning, Friedman attempted to moderate his stance on various regional issues, expressing some openness to a two-state solution and agreeing with Trump's reservations about settlement activity's impact on peace efforts. Despite criticism, Friedman is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham endorsing him as competent and aligned with Trump's priorities. In contrast, a group of former U.S. ambassadors to Israel, spanning both Republican and Democratic administrations, urged the Senate to reject Friedman, citing his extreme positions on key issues. As Trump vowed during his campaign, plans to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, solidifying the city as Israel's capital, persist despite international objections."}

The shock resignation thrust Lebanon into a regional rivalry between Riyadh and its allies against an Iranian bloc, which includes the Hezbollah militant group and political party.     Rifi said he has been in touch with Saudi officials recently over Lebanon s crisis and is familiar with Riyadh s thinking.

Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to \" being pro @-@ choice at a [ then @-@ US president ] Bush rally and trying to make your point \" . Subsequently , the band opted to organize their own tour in support of the album , choosing to work with Melvins , Skeleton Key and DÃ¤lek . Speaking about the planning required to stage a four @-@ act tour , Patton stated \" that 's a lot of music . That 's a lot of time to be sitting in some stinking @-@ ass club with some guy puking in your purse \" . Tool 's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video , but the offer was declined by the band .

Writing for AllRovi , Daphne Carr awarded the album a rating of four stars out of five , adding that it \" expand [ s ] the borders of guitar rock with intelligence and humor \" . Carr felt that \" You Can 't Win \" and \" Rape This Day \" were among the album 's best songs , and compared the overall sound to the work of avant @-@ garde musician Frank Zappa . Pitchfork Media 's Scott Hreha rated the album 8 @.@ 4 out of 10 , finding that the band seemed to compliment each other musically more than they had on their previous album . Hreha singled out \" You Can 't Win \" , \" Mayday \" and \" Rape This Day \" as highlights of the record , and praised the album 's ability to \" straddle the distance between ambience and onslaught \" . Stephen Hang of PopMatters felt that the album was rewarding but challenging to listeners , and that Patton 's lyrics were deliberately obtuse . Hang was positive about the album 's sound , but described the release as having \" deliver [ ed ] the goods for Patton â s small , devoted cult audience \" .\nSpin magazine awarded the album a \" B â \" rating , describing it as \" heavy on nuts and bolts , light on bolts from the blue \" . The reviewer felt that the group 's lineup suggested a greater potential than the resultant album offered , but called it \" solid \" nonetheless . Matt Rhodes , writing for Consequence of Sound , reviewed the album positively , stating that \" frankly , this album sounds like dark , kinky sex \" . Rhodes compared it to the works of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin , and felt that Denison 's guitar parts served to specifically compliment Patton 's vocals , rather than attempting to stand out for themselves . Tom Mallon of CMJ New Music Monthly felt that the album presented a more cohesive group than was present on Tomahawk , allowing the band to \" [ step ] out of the shadows \" of their previous careers . Mallon praised Patton 's vocal performances , finding them to be his most diverse work since the 1999 Mr. Bungle album California .\n\n= = Chart performance = =\n\nIn the United States , Mit Gas reached a peak position of 137 in the Billboard 200 albums chart , spending two weeks in the chart .

It was the twelfth named storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season and originated on October 9 from a tropical wave located southwest of Mexico. Unfortunately, unfavorable conditions led to the system dissipating within two days of formation, moving eastward. Following an interaction with a disturbance to the east, Norman regenerated just off the Mexican coast on October 15. The cyclone's center quickly disorganized and dissipated, spreading a significant area of moisture that brought around 6 inches (150 mm) of rainfall to southwestern Mexico. This rainfall led to flooding in approximately 150 houses, with 20 homes being destroyed. While one person was injured, initial reports mentioned two missing individuals due to the storm, although this was not confirmed later on.\n\n= = Meteorological Background = =\n\nOriginating from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on September 21, Norman traveled through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with minimal development before entering the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 1. By October 5, persistent convection began to form as the system moved westward. Although initially disorganized, gradual development was anticipated due to improving conditions in the upper atmosphere. By October 7, the system developed into a broad low-pressure area, ultimately leading to the formation of Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 9, approximately 765 miles (1235 km) southwest of the Baja California Peninsula.\nInitially moving in a north-northwest direction, the depression was expected to intensify gradually before weakening and crossing the Baja California Peninsula, as projected by the National Hurricane Center. Upon reaching tropical storm status, Norman continued to strengthen, peaking with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 10. However, increased southwesterly wind shear and a trough extending from California prompted Norman to stall, turn to the east, and eventually degenerate into a remnant low on October 11 southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\nInteracting with a tropical disturbance off the Mexican coast, Norman's remnants redeveloped into a tropical depression on October 15 near southwestern Mexico before dissipating south and offshore of Manzanillo, Colima, later that day.\n\n= = Preparedness and Effects = =\n\nFollowing Norman's redevelopment, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Lázaro Cárdenas to Cabo Corrientes. The storm brought substantial rainfall, with La Villita, Michoacán experiencing the highest recorded rainfall at 6.35 inches (161 mm). As a result of the flooding caused by four days of rainfall, schools in and around Acapulco were closed. The heavy rainfall led to downed trees, mudslides, and the flooding of around 150 homes, necessitating military assistance in evacuating affected households. In total, 20 homes were destroyed, and 20 villages were left without power. One injury was reported when a transport vehicle carrying 15 people was swept away by a flooded stream, later rescued by police workers. Approximately 300 hectares (740 acres) of crop fields sustained damage, although minimal crop loss was reported as the storm occurred post-harvest. Norman impacted roughly 500,000 individuals across Mexico, and while two people were initially reported missing, subsequent information indicated no casualties were linked to the storm."}
{"src_passage": "GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) -  There is more work to be done  to unlock Brexit talks, British Prime Minister Theresa May was told on Friday, as the European Union repeated an early December deadline for her to move on the divorce bill and border with Ireland. May met fellow leaders on the sidelines of an EU summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, to try to break the deadlock over how much Britain will pay on leaving the bloc in 16 months. She signalled again that she would increase an initial offer that is estimated at some 20 billion euros, about a third of what Brussels wants. But without any immediate plans to detail which financial commitments Britain was planning to cover and with a growing row with Ireland over their shared border, European Council President Donald Tusk, who coordinates Brexit for the bloc s other 27 leaders, concluded Britain must take further steps. He increased the pressure on May to make progress by early  December, in time for the EU to react at a summit on Dec. 14-15, or risk losing a chance to push the talks to a discussion of future trade ties, something London desperately wants so it can offer some certainty to nervy businesses. Asked about Brexit minister David Davis complaining that Britain had made  all the running  in finding compromises on the third key divorce issue   the rights of expatriate citizens, Tusk said pointedly:  I can say only that I really appreciate Mr. Davis s English sense of humour.   He told the news conference:  While good progress on citizens has been made, we need to see much more progress on Ireland and on the financial settlement.  In order to avoid any ambiguity about our work calendar, I made it very clear to prime minister May that this progress needs to happen at the beginning of December at the latest.  It was an echo of the ultimatum issued by the EU s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who a week ago gave Davis until the end of the month to detail the British approach to the financial settlement   and effectively increase the money on the table. But Tusk, who met May earlier on Friday, added another demand - more progress on the future status of the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which Britain says is almost impossible to make without discussing the future trade deal as that would determine the kind of customs needed. Under pressure at home from members of parliament in her own party who are concerned she is preparing for Britain to walk away with no deal and from the EU, May has tried to gloss over the differences and emphasise how far the talks have come.  We ve agreed that good progress has been made. More does need to be done. But we re clear, and I m clear, that what we need to do is move forward together and that is how we can ensure that we are going to get the best deal for the United Kingdom and the European Union,  May told reporters. But a growing row with Ireland broke into the open on Friday, with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney saying Dublin was not ready to allow the talks to move onto a discussion of future trade next month. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar went further.  I can t say in any honesty that it s close on the Irish issue or on the financial settlement,  he told Sky News.  After 40 years of marriage, most of them good, now Britain wants a divorce but an open relationship the day after.  With German Chancellor Angela Merkel absent from the summit because of government formation talks in Berlin, it was left to French President Emmanuel Macron to speak for the heavyweight powers which are taking a tough line with London:  We won t change the agreed process in any way, and we won t open talks on the future relationship as long as the conditions set in the first phase have not been met,  he said Sweden. But May, weakened after losing her Conservative Party s majority at a June election she did not need to call, has little room for manoeuvre. Some of her team of ministers are pressing her to hold off from naming a figure, seeing it as one of the few levers Britain has to press for better trade deal. Despite the tough language, Tusk offered some hope.  I feel much better, safer after my meeting with Theresa May, everything is possible,  the former Polish premier said.

Under the Royal Line banner, the Cairo was renamed Royal Edward, and the Heliopolis became Royal George after being refitted for North Atlantic operations.

Subsequently, the Royal Edward encountered a tragic fate when it was struck by a torpedo fired by the German submarine UB-14, leading to its swift sinking off Kandeloussa. Despite distress signals being sent out, the vessel succumbed within minutes, resulting in a substantial loss of life. Rescue efforts managed to save some survivors, but a significant number of individuals perished. Conflicting reports varied on the exact casualty figures, with some sources indicating different estimates ranging from 132 to 1,386 or even 1,865.

{"src_passage": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Two of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s closest allies have initiated legislation in what opponents say is a rearguard action to try to shield him from a police probe into corruption allegations against him. Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases, one into alleged meddling in the media industry and the other into gifts he received from rich businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing. But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate. Two lawmakers who want Netanyahu to stay in power have proposed two new draft laws that have alarmed the attorney-general and the police. One would bar police from providing prosecutors with the investigators  conclusions on whether charges should be brought against suspects. The second, known as the  French Law  because of similarities with legislation in France, would delay any investigation of a prime minister until he or she leaves office. Netanyahu, a right-wing leader now in his fourth term, has said he has no interest in promoting personal legislation, but he has not ordered his coalition head, David Bitan and his co-sponsor of the bills, David Amsalem, to withdraw the bills. Bitan said that once police publish their findings, suspects are convicted in the court of public opinion even if they are eventually cleared. Those who oppose the draft bills are more worried about toppling Netanyahu than about democracy, he said.  They (the bills) protect democracy. Suspects have rights too,  Bitan told Reuters.  The  French Law  has not yet been brought before parliament. Coalition partners are at odds over its phrasing but Bitan says he will not shelve the legislation.

", "predictions": "Rewritten Passage:\nIn Jerusalem, two of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's most trusted allies have proposed legislation that critics argue is an attempt to protect him from a police investigation into corruption allegations. Netanyahu is facing suspicion in two cases - one involving alleged interference in the media sector, and the other concerning gifts he received from affluent individuals. Despite denying any wrongdoing, if charged, he would face significant pressure to resign or call for an election to confirm his mandate. The lawmakers pushing for Netanyahu to remain in office have introduced two new bills that have raised concerns among the attorney-general and the police. One of the bills aims to prevent the police from sharing their findings with prosecutors regarding potential charges against suspects, while the other, dubbed the \"French Law,\" seeks to postpone any inquiry into a sitting prime minister until they leave office. Netanyahu, a conservative leader serving his fourth term, has stated that he is not interested in advancing personal laws, but he has not directed his coalition leaders, David Bitan and David Amsalem, to retract the bills. Bitan believes that releasing police conclusions can lead to public condemnation of suspects even if they are later cleared. He argues that those opposing the bills are more concerned with toppling Netanyahu than preserving democracy. Bitan insists that the proposed \"French Law\" will not affect the ongoing investigations against the prime minister, but could potentially impact future legal actions involving Netanyahu in a different case. The initial draft of one bill has been approved by parliament, but both bills may not progress further to become laws. Despite disagreements among coalition partners over the wording of the \"French Law,\" Bitan is determined to pursue its enactment. Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit has expressed concerns about the intentions behind these legislative moves, labeling them as potential threats. He criticized the political nature of these proposals, indicating that they are not part of a fair democratic process. Mandelblit voiced his dismay at facing attacks from various quarters with tactics that don't adhere to democratic norms. Additionally, police disclosed that they have faced political pressure, but affirmed their commitment to combating crime and corruption without succumbing to any attempts to undermine their work. The ongoing investigations involving Netanyahu are named Case 1000 and Case 2000, with the former focusing on gifts from businessmen and the latter on allegations of a media coverage arrangement. Netanyahu has maintained his innocence, describing the cases as part of a political smear campaign against him. While there is no legal obligation for him to step down if indicted, some experts predict that Netanyahu might opt for early elections to renew his public mandate if charged. Past prime ministers have also faced police investigations, with only Ehud Olmert being convicted of bribery charges. The procedure typically involves the police collecting evidence before the Attorney-General and prosecutors decide on filing charges. Mordechai Kremnitzer, a law professor, and Israel Democracy Institute Vice President, criticized Netanyahu's coalition for abusing legislative power to shield him from legal issues, citing it as a stark example of immoderation and audacity."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday ordered reviews of major banking rules that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, drawing fire from Democrats who said his order lacked substance and squarely aligned him with Wall Street bankers. Though the order was short on specifics, financial markets embraced Trump’s signal that looser banking regulation is coming and pushed bank stocks higher. The Dow Jones U.S. Banks stocks index closed up 2.6 percent. .DJUSBK [.N]  At a White House forum on Friday with U.S. business leaders, including JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon, Trump said his administration expects “to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” That will involve a lot more than issuing an order, said former Democratic congressman Barney Frank, co-author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that raised capital requirements for banks, restricted their trading by means of the “Volcker Rule,” and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to guard against predatory lending. Trump “can’t make any substantial change in the financial reform bill without Congress,” Frank told Reuters. “The language in the order doesn’t do anything. It tells the secretary of the Treasury to give them something to read. The tone of it is to weaken the bill.” Trump and other critics of the Dodd-Frank law say its regulations have hindered lending. At the meeting with CEO’s on Friday Trump said, “I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses that can’t borrow money...because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.” Despite such criticisms, recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed U.S. commercial-bank lending at a 70-year high, climbing steadily since late-2010. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren who lobbied for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Trump of forsaking middle and lower-income individuals to help banks. “The Wall Street bankers and lobbyists whose greed and recklessness nearly destroyed this country may be toasting each other with champagne, but the American people have not forgotten the 2008 financial crisis - and they will not forget what happened today,” she said in a statement. Trump’s adviser leading the deregulation effort, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, was previously a top official at Goldman Sachs (GS.N). Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, meanwhile, is counseling Trump on regulation across the government. One order signed by Trump requires the U.S. Treasury Secretary to submit possible regulatory changes and legislation modifying Dodd-Frank in 120 days, according to a White House official. Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, also a former Goldman banker, has yet to be confirmed by the full Senate. Meanwhile, a memo tells the Labor Department to review a “fiduciary rule” for brokers offering retirement advice that was finalized in 2016. While early reports said Trump wanted to push off the rule’s implementation, originally slated for April, by 180 days, the order did not mention any delay. The Labor Department late on Friday said it was considering legal options for delaying.  Representatives of the six largest U.S. banks – JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) – either declined to comment or did not have an immediate comment. Bankers, lawyers and lobbyists privately said Trump’s order would not do much immediately. Also they said that they would prefer less-extensive modifications to Dodd-Frank after spending billions of dollars complying with the law. Many want to make it “a little bit more user-friendly,” said John Kanas, chairman of BankUnited (BKU.N), a lender with less than $20 billion in assets.  House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican, told reporters at the White House that Trump’s approach reflects legislation he has drafted to review Dodd-Frank. Hensarling is expected to re-introduce his bill allowing banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank and holding more capital later this month. Trump could also make changes simply by appointing new personnel or not enforcing rules. “A lot of the regulations of Dodd-Frank required a bit of a cop-on-the-beat if you will, to ensure enforcement and if you have a different cop-on-the-beat, they enforce different rules, or they enforce the rules differently,” said FBR & CO financial policy analyst Edward Mills. Many regulators, though, were appointed by Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and intend to complete their terms. Trump cannot fire heads of independent agencies, including the three top bank regulators: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Martin Gruenberg.  In addition, the term for Richard Cordray, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, stretches into next year. Republican lawmakers are pushing Trump to fire Cordray, but a federal court’s decision allowing him to has been stayed pending appeal.

Despite lacking specific details, Trump's move was well-received by financial markets, leading to a rise in bank stocks. During a meeting at the White House with business leaders, Trump indicated a plan to reduce regulations outlined in the Dodd-Frank law, a measure met with skepticism by former Congressman Barney Frank, one of the law's architects. Frank emphasized that significant changes to financial regulations would require congressional approval, and the current directive appeared to merely instruct the Treasury Secretary to propose amendments. Critics of Dodd-Frank argue that the regulations have restricted lending, a claim Trump echoed during the meeting with CEOs. However, recent data suggests that commercial bank lending in the U.S. has been steadily increasing. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Trump for prioritizing the interests of banks over those of middle and lower-income individuals. Trump's move to deregulate is spearheaded by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, formerly of Goldman Sachs, with input from investor Carl Icahn. One of the orders mandates the Treasury Secretary to present potential changes to Dodd-Frank within 120 days. The Labor Department is also directed to review a rule affecting retirement advice, though it remains unclear if the rule's implementation will be delayed. Major U.S. banks declined to comment on the order, expressing a preference for more moderate adjustments to Dodd-Frank. Republican lawmakers are backing Trump's approach to potentially alter the law, while financial policy experts differ in their opinions, with some advocating to retain the current regulations."}

He commenced his education at Gil St. Bernards in New Jersey, where he crossed paths with his future teammate Alex Hewit during an entrance exam for Delbarton School in New Jersey when they were in sixth grade. Even at Delbarton in seventh grade, Cocoziello, initially a baseball enthusiast, was introduced to lacrosse during informal sessions with peers. His transition to lacrosse began in earnest when he acquired a stick and dedicated himself to honing his skills. By eighth grade, he had joined the school team and excelled, eventually making it to the New Jersey state eighth-grade all-star squad alongside Hewit, competing against standout players from other states. Subsequently, he progressed to the varsity team, contributing significantly to their impressive record of 63-4 and securing three high school lacrosse state championships. Notably, he was identified as the top high school lacrosse recruit in the nation in 2003 by Inside Lacrosse.

This type of battery falls under the category of biobatteries and was commonly used in early scientific studies on electricity and for educational demonstrations.\n\nThe concept behind the frog battery lies in the creation of potential injury within a muscle when it is harmed, although this aspect was not fully grasped during the 18th and 19th centuries. The potential is inadvertently produced during the dissection of the frog's muscles.\n\nThe frog battery represents a type of biobattery that can be assembled using various animals. The general term used for such a category is the muscular pile.\n\nOne of the most renowned frog batteries was developed by Carlo Matteucci in 1845, though there were earlier versions created by others. Matteucci also engineered batteries using different animals, while Giovanni Aldini constructed a battery using ox heads.\n\n= = Background = =\n\nIn the early stages of electrical exploration, a common method for detecting electric current was through the use of a frog's leg galvanoscope. Researchers typically kept a ready supply of live frogs for the preparation of their legs for the galvanoscope. Frogs were deemed convenient for experiments due to their small size, ease of handling, the sensitivity of their legs to electric currents, and their sustained response compared to other animals in similar roles.\n\n= = Preparation = =\n\nTypically, the frog thighs were utilized in constructing the battery. The frog's legs were initially skinned, and the lower part of the leg was removed at the knee joint and discarded. Care was taken to avoid damaging the muscle during this process to ensure accurate results. The thigh muscle was then horizontally cut into two halves, keeping only the lower conical part. These half-thighs were placed on an insulated surface made of varnished wood so that the inner side of one piece touched the outer side of the next piece, with the conical ends inserted into the cut surface cavity. The battery's terminals were formed by placing the ends of the pile in water-filled cups set into the wood.\n\nThe alignment of the inner and outer surfaces was based on the erroneous belief that there was a continuous flow of electric current within muscles from the inside to the outside. It is now understood that the half-thighs were more effective in generating electricity due to the higher muscle injury. This enhancement of electric potential due to injury is known as demarcation potential or injury potential.\n\nOther variations in construction were also possible, such as using complete hind legs with exposed sciatic nerves to connect one frog's nerve to the next frog's feet. Whole frogs could also be employed, although the preparation of thigh muscles was more time-consuming, many experimenters preferred this method for superior outcomes.\n\n= = History = =\n\nThe first frog battery was assembled by Eusebio Valli in the 1790s using a chain of 10 frogs. Valli encountered difficulties in comprehending his results and was influenced by Luigi Galvani's perspective that animal electricity was distinct from metal-metal electricity, a view Alessandro Volta later proved incorrect with his voltaic pile devoid of animal components. Leopoldo Nobili constructed a frog battery in 1818 using complete frog legs, known as a frog pile, to investigate animal electricity. His experiments faced criticism from Volta, who argued that the actual source of electricity was the dissimilar metals in the external circuit.\n\nCarlo Matteucci's notable frog battery was documented in a paper presented to the Royal Society in 1845 by Michael Faraday on his behalf. Matteucci's battery, composed of 12 to 14 half-thighs of frogs, was powerful enough to decompose potassium iodide. Matteucci aimed to substantiate the existence of animal electricity by constructing a biological circuit. Frogs were not the only creatures utilized in batteries; Giovanni Aldini demonstrated in 1803 that electricity could be obtained from an ox head. Later, Matteucci extended battery experimentation to eels, pigeons, rabbits, and even living pigeons in a design inspired by an existing battery configuration using living frogs."}
{"src_passage": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump fired Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager who helped him win Republican presidential nominating contests but clashed with other advisers on how to appeal to the broader general electorate, several people with knowledge of the decision said on Monday. The firing on Monday morning was another shakeup for a campaign already at odds with many senior Republican figures over the presumptive nominee’s policies, with the party’s nominating convention in Cleveland less than a month away.  But it may also prove a step toward calming concerns among party leaders about Trump, a wealthy businessman and political outsider, and the conflicting advice he was getting from senior aides, as he battles presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trump said Lewandowski did “a great job” but “it’s time now for a different kind of a campaign.” “We ran a small, beautiful, well-unified campaign. It worked very well in the primaries. I think I’m probably going to do some of that,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News, in which he did not say if Lewandowski had been fired. Three people close to the campaign said some of Trump’s staff viewed Lewandowski as opposing strategic changes and staff hires urged for the general election campaign by Paul Manafort, a strategist hired in April partly for his experience on presidential campaigns that Lewandowski lacked. The three, a campaign staffer and two people in regular contact with Trump advisers, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by Trump to discuss the firing. Manafort will take over as campaign manager, said Carl Paladino, co-chairman of the campaign’s operations in New York state. “Paul’s in charge,” Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee’s communications director, said in an interview. Trump’s decision to fire his manager came in part at the urging of his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who have powerful advisory roles in the campaign, the two people in contact with Trump aides said.  Hope Hicks, who single-handedly fields Trump’s media inquiries, disputed reports she had complained about Lewandowski to Ivanka Trump. “That is entirely untrue,” she said. Lewandowski, 42, had been a near-constant presence at Trump’s side since the New York developer launched his campaign on June 2015.  In a brief statement read on CNN, Lewandowski said: “I stand by the fact that Mr. Trump is a great candidate and is better than Hillary Clinton ever will be.”  Lewandowski denied there were any tensions between him and Trump’s family in an interview with CNN. Later on Monday, a campaign adviser resigned after reveling in Lewandowski’s exit on his Twitter account, CNN reported. “Ding dong the witch is dead!” Michael Caputo, the adviser, wrote shortly after reports of the firing emerged. He later released a statement to CNN saying he had resigned. “In hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move,” his statement said. The RNC spokesman did not think there would be a change in Trump’s tone. “It’s going to be more of a streamlined effort and more of an understanding of the difference that a general election has,” Spicer said. Clinton’s campaign has hundreds more staff than that of Trump. In contrast to her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid, there has been no public sign this time of any significant infighting among her advisers. The former U.S. secretary of state has also spent millions of dollars on television commercials in recent weeks. Trump has not aired any paid advertisements since becoming the presumptive nominee, preferring to spread his message through his Twitter account and in media interviews. Trump has faced setbacks in the past two weeks. His renewed calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States have drawn heavy criticism from Republican politicians in Washington and prompted corporate sponsors like Apple and JPMorgan Chase to withhold funding from the party’s July 18-21 convention. Recent opinion polls show at least half of all voters approve of the Muslim ban. Lewandowski, a former New Hampshire field director for a conservative advocacy group, argued that Trump’s unconventional campaigning style did not need to be changed after it proved successful in the last few months of primary contests. Lewandowski repeatedly defended that strategy with a line that became his mantra: “Let Trump be Trump.”  Known for his brusque manner, Lewandowski was accused of manhandling a female reporter in Florida during the primary campaign, but the battery charge against him was later dropped. He is still scheduled to attend the Cleveland convention as chairman of New Hampshire’s delegation.

However, there were disagreements within the campaign about how to broaden its appeal to the general public. The decision to fire Lewandowski on Monday morning marked a further shakeup in a campaign that was already facing opposition from many senior figures in the Republican Party. The upcoming nominating convention in Cleveland added to the tension, with Trump facing criticism over his policies. Nonetheless, the move could be a step towards addressing concerns among party leaders about Trump's approach as he competes against Hillary Clinton in the November election. Trump commended Lewandowski for his past work but indicated a need for a different campaign strategy moving forward. Reports suggest that Lewandowski resisted certain strategic changes and new hires proposed by Paul Manafort, an experienced strategist brought in to bolster the campaign for the general election. Manafort is set to assume the role of campaign manager following Lewandowski's dismissal, a decision influenced in part by Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Hope Hicks, who handles Trump's media inquiries, refuted claims that she had raised complaints about Lewandowski. The former campaign manager, who had been by Trump's side since the campaign's inception, expressed support for Trump and denied any friction with his family. A campaign adviser resigned after celebrating Lewandowski's departure on Twitter, a move that was later deemed overly enthusiastic. The campaign is expected to undergo a more streamlined and focused effort, adjusting to the dynamics of the general election. In contrast, Clinton's campaign has a larger staff and has been relatively free of internal conflicts. The differences between the two candidates' campaign styles have also been highlighted by their respective spending on advertisements. Trump, known for his controversial remarks, recently faced backlash for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., drawing criticism even from within his own party. Despite Lewandowski's departure, the impact on Trump's overall strategy remains uncertain."}
{"src_passage": "(Reuters) - While one focus of the leak crackdown announced on Friday by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is on journalists who receive leaked information, another is on suspected leakers. Republican President Donald Trump has complained for months about leaks to the news media, but his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also took a hard line on leaking.  Eight of the 12 cases where federal prosecutors charged individuals with violating the Espionage Act, a World War One-era law aimed at keeping sensitive information out of the hands of the United States’ enemies, were brought under Obama. Here are the 12 cases, dating back 46 years. Daniel Ellsberg became the first such case in 1971 when prosecutors accused the national security analyst and his colleague, Anthony Russo, of providing what would become known as the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times and other media outlets. The secret documents revealed the extent of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Charges against the two men were dismissed when a judge found that the government had wiretapped Ellsberg, possibly illegally. Samuel Morison, a former Navy intelligence analyst, was charged in 1984 with illegally passing secret photographs of Soviet ships to a magazine, Jane’s Defence Weekly. He pleaded not guilty, but a jury convicted him, making him the first person convicted under the Espionage Act for divulging secrets to the press. He was sentenced to two years in prison but paroled. President Bill Clinton pardoned him. Lawrence Franklin, a Defense Department employee, was charged in 2005 with passing classified information about Iran to two pro-Israel lobbyists, Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman. Franklin pleaded guilty and received a 12-year sentence. Eventually, after the government’s case against Rosen and Weissman collapsed, a judge reduced Franklin’s sentence to 10 months in a halfway house. Shamai Leibowitz was an FBI translator when material that he heard while translating ended up on a blog. He reached an agreement with prosecutors before he was charged, and pleaded guilty in 2009 to one count of disclosing classified information. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Former National Security Agency official Thomas Drake was suspected in 2010 of revealing information about the agency’s warrantless wiretapping program.

The 10 felony counts were dropped when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and received no prison time. Chelsea Manning, an Army private first class formerly known as Bradley Manning, turned over more than 700,000 classified files to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks in the biggest breach of secret data in U.S. history.

A grand jury indicted him in 2010 for disclosing defense information and making false statements. He pleaded guilty in 2014 and was sentenced to thirteen months in prison. He was released in May 2015.  Former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was charged in 2011 with illegally disclosing classified information about Iran to James Risen, a New York Times reporter, for his book “State of War.” A jury convicted Sterling in 2015. A judge sentenced him to 42 months in prison.  Former CIA officer John Kiriakou was charged in 2012 with divulging to journalists secret information about the CIA’s interrogation program, including the identity of a covert officer. In an agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. He was released in February 2015 on condition that he serve three months of house arrest.

Republican President Donald Trump has complained for months about leaks to the news media, but his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also took a hard line on leaking.  Eight of the 12 cases where federal prosecutors charged individuals with violating the Espionage Act, a World War One-era law aimed at keeping sensitive information out of the hands of the United States’ enemies, were brought under Obama. Here are the 12 cases, dating back 46 years. Daniel Ellsberg became the first such case in 1971 when prosecutors accused the national security analyst and his colleague, Anthony Russo, of providing what would become known as the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times and other media outlets. The secret documents revealed the extent of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Charges against the two men were dismissed when a judge found that the government had wiretapped Ellsberg, possibly illegally. Samuel Morison, a former Navy intelligence analyst, was charged in 1984 with illegally passing secret photographs of Soviet ships to a magazine, Jane’s Defence Weekly. He pleaded not guilty, but a jury convicted him, making him the first person convicted under the Espionage Act for divulging secrets to the press. He was sentenced to two years in prison but paroled. President Bill Clinton pardoned him. Lawrence Franklin, a Defense Department employee, was charged in 2005 with passing classified information about Iran to two pro-Israel lobbyists, Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman. Franklin pleaded guilty and received a 12-year sentence. Eventually, after the government’s case against Rosen and Weissman collapsed, a judge reduced Franklin’s sentence to 10 months in a halfway house. Shamai Leibowitz was an FBI translator when material that he heard while translating ended up on a blog. He reached an agreement with prosecutors before he was charged, and pleaded guilty in 2009 to one count of disclosing classified information. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Former National Security Agency official Thomas Drake was suspected in 2010 of revealing information about the agency’s warrantless wiretapping program. He was indicted under the Espionage Act but said the only information he leaked was about waste in an NSA program, which he gave to the Baltimore Sun.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday he wants bipartisan cooperation on tax reform, as pressure on him to produce a legislative victory on any front escalated with the collapse of the latest Republican push to repeal Obamacare. The administration and Republicans in Congress are due to unveil a tax plan on Wednesday. The plan has been developed over several months by six White House and congressional Republicans working behind closed doors and with no input from Democrats. On the eve of its unveiling, Trump told members of the House of Representatives tax committee from both parties: “I’ve asked lawmakers of both parties to join us to discuss our framework. ... It’s time for both parties to come together.” He said lawmakers should expect a “very, very powerful document” that would deliver a big tax cut for the middle class. “We will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class - not just a little bit, but tremendously,” said the president, who is set to travel to Indianapolis on Wednesday to unveil the plan. Republicans, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress have been unable to deliver a significant legislative win on any topic since Trump took office in January. Senate Republicans admitted failure on Tuesday in their latest push to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare,, raising pressure on the party to overhaul the tax code this year, although that difficult effort has repeatedly been delayed. Republicans and Democrats who met with Trump on Tuesday said afterward that the president indicated an interest in working with Democrats on both tax reform and healthcare going forward. “He said you get a better deal if it’s bipartisan,” said Representative Richard Neal, the panel’s top Democrat. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch has also called for bipartisan tax reform. Details of the Trump tax plan that have leaked out showed that the corporate income tax rate would be slashed to 20 percent from 35 percent, the rate for “pass-through” businesses to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, and the rate for top individual earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent The U.S. tax code has not been overhauled since 1986 under Republican President Ronald Reagan. In the years since, it has gotten much more complex, skewed toward special interests and insufficient for raising enough revenue to cover Washington’s spending, producing a federal budget deficit. As the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have tried in recent months to forge a tax plan, their work has focused mostly on cutting tax rates and less on attempting a comprehensive overhaul of the code.   The Trump plan is expected to be light on specifics, particularly on how to pay for its proposed tax cuts, although Neal said the White House pushed hard on the idea of eliminating the deduction for state and local tax payments. Lawmakers said some key tax rates were still in flux on Tuesday.  Without offsets such as the closing of lucrative tax loopholes to pay for lower tax rates, the proposed tax cuts would deeply cut federal revenue by about $5 trillion in a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation think tank. Such huge revenue losses, as well as the plan’s anticipated inclusion of a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, could make cooperation difficult for Democrats, who want tax reform to be revenue neutral and to offer no relief for top earners. Neal said Trump showed a readiness to avoid cutting taxes for the wealthy during their meeting. “He said, quote, the rich will not benefit,” said the Massachusetts Democrat. Representative James Renacci, a Ways and Means Committee Republican, said individual tax rates were still under discussion, including the possibility of raising the tax rate for the poorest taxpayers to 12 percent from 10 percent.  “There are a lot of questions on where we’re at in that area at this point. Some things are not totally tied down,” Renacci told Reuters. “We’ve got some tweaking to do.” Among Republicans, even fiscal hawks were showing a willingness to accept huge revenue losses, predicting that aggressive tax cuts would drive future economic growth and produce new tax revenues that would pay for lower rates. Such economic assumptions have been questioned by Democrats, who say that the Trump tax plan will unfairly favor the wealthy and that providing them with tax cuts does not drive growth.  Senate Republicans tentatively agreed last week that tax legislation could lose up to $1.5 trillion over a decade, but become revenue neutral thereafter due to economic growth.

He assured that the plan would significantly reduce taxes for middle-class Americans. The President is set to reveal the plan in Indianapolis, with Republicans striving to secure a major legislative victory since Trump's inauguration. While facing challenges, Trump indicated an openness to collaborating with Democrats on tax reform and healthcare moving forward. The leaked details of the tax plan suggest substantial cuts to corporate and individual tax rates, with the last major overhaul of the U.S. tax code dating back to 1986. The plan is anticipated to focus mainly on rate reductions rather than a comprehensive reform, prompting concerns over revenue losses and distributional impacts. Despite uncertainties surrounding specifics, there is a push to eliminate certain tax deductions, although key rates remain subject to negotiation. The potential revenue shortfall resulting from proposed tax cuts has raised concerns, particularly regarding benefits to high-income earners. Some Republicans are optimistic that aggressive tax cuts could spur economic growth, offsetting revenue losses in the long term. However, Democrats have criticized the plan for favoring the wealthy and questioned its economic assumptions. Discussions are ongoing within Congress, with various lawmakers voicing differing opinions on tax rates and revenue implications."}
{"src_passage": "= Problem of Apollonius =\n\nIn Euclidean plane geometry , Apollonius 's problem is to construct circles that are tangent to three given circles in a plane ( Figure 1 ) . Apollonius of Perga ( ca . 262 BC â ca . 190 BC ) posed and solved this famous problem in his work á¼ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î¯ ( EpaphaÃ­ , \" Tangencies \" ) ; this work has been lost , but a 4th @-@ century report of his results by Pappus of Alexandria has survived . Three given circles generically have eight different circles that are tangent to them ( Figure 2 ) and each solution circle encloses or excludes the three given circles in a different way : in each solution , a different subset of the three circles is enclosed ( its complement is excluded ) and there are 8 subsets of a set whose cardinality is 3 , since 8 = 23 .\nIn the 16th century , Adriaan van Roomen solved the problem using intersecting hyperbolas , but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions . FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases : any of the three given circles can be shrunk to zero radius ( a point ) or expanded to infinite radius ( a line ) . ViÃ¨te 's approach , which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones , is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius ' method . The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton , who showed that Apollonius ' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points . This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN .\nLater mathematicians introduced algebraic methods , which transform a geometric problem into algebraic equations . These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries inherent in the problem of Apollonius : for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs , with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes ( Figure 2 ) . Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution , while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify the configuration of the given circles . These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods ( using Lie sphere geometry ) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles .\nApollonius ' problem has stimulated much further work . Generalizations to three dimensions â constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres â and beyond have been studied . The configuration of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention . RenÃ© Descartes gave a formula relating the radii of the solution circles and the given circles , now known as Descartes ' theorem . Solving Apollonius ' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket , which is one of the earliest fractals to be described in print , and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy â Littlewood circle method .\n\n= = Statement of the problem = =\n\nThe general statement of Apollonius ' problem is to construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane , where an object may be a line , a point or a circle of any size . These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another ; however , they are usually taken to be distinct , meaning that they do not coincide . Solutions to Apollonius ' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles , although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius .\nThe property of tangency is defined as follows . First , a point , line or circle is assumed to be tangent to itself ; hence , if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects , it is counted as a solution to Apollonius ' problem .

Apollonius of Perga ( ca . 262 BC â ca . 190 BC ) posed and solved this famous problem in his work á¼ÏÎ±ÏÎ±Î¯ ( EpaphaÃ­ , \" Tangencies \" ) ; this work has been lost , but a 4th @-@ century report of his results by Pappus of Alexandria has survived . Three given circles generically have eight different circles that are tangent to them ( Figure 2 ) and each solution circle encloses or excludes the three given circles in a different way : in each solution , a different subset of the three circles is enclosed ( its complement is excluded ) and there are 8 subsets of a set whose cardinality is 3 , since 8 = 23 .\nIn the 16th century , Adriaan van Roomen solved the problem using intersecting hyperbolas , but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions . FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases : any of the three given circles can be shrunk to zero radius ( a point ) or expanded to infinite radius ( a line ) . ViÃ¨te 's approach , which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones , is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius ' method . The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton , who showed that Apollonius ' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points . This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN .\nLater mathematicians introduced algebraic methods , which transform a geometric problem into algebraic equations . These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries inherent in the problem of Apollonius : for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs , with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes ( Figure 2 ) . Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution , while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify the configuration of the given circles . These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods ( using Lie sphere geometry ) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles .\nApollonius ' problem has stimulated much further work . Generalizations to three dimensions â constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres â and beyond have been studied . The configuration of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention . RenÃ© Descartes gave a formula relating the radii of the solution circles and the given circles , now known as Descartes ' theorem . Solving Apollonius ' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket , which is one of the earliest fractals to be described in print , and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy â Littlewood circle method .\n\n= = Statement of the problem = =\n\nThe general statement of Apollonius ' problem is to construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane , where an object may be a line , a point or a circle of any size . These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another ; however , they are usually taken to be distinct , meaning that they do not coincide . Solutions to Apollonius ' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles , although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius .\nThe property of tangency is defined as follows . First , a point , line or circle is assumed to be tangent to itself ; hence , if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects , it is counted as a solution to Apollonius ' problem . Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common . By definition , a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them , that is , if it lies on them ; thus , two distinct points cannot be tangent . If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero , they are said to be tangent ; the intersection point is called a tangent point or a point of tangency . ( The word \" tangent \" derives from the Latin present participle , tangens , meaning \" touching \" . ) In practice , two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point ; if they intersect at zero or two points , they are not tangent .

Apollonius of Perga, an ancient mathematician who lived around 262 BC to 190 BC, initially proposed and successfully tackled this renowned problem in his lost work called \"Tangencies\" (Epaphaí); however, a documentation of his outcomes by Pappus of Alexandria from the 4th century has been preserved. When three circles are given, there exist eight distinct circles that can be tangential to them, with each solution circle either encompassing or excluding the three given circles in varying ways. Notably, these solutions enclose a different subset of the three circles in each scenario. The problem involves 8 subsets of a set of 3 elements, resulting in 8 possibilities since 8 is equal to 2 cubed.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen approached the problem using intersecting hyperbolas, deviating from the conventional straightedge and compass constructions. Another mathematician, François Viète, offered a solution by leveraging extreme cases, where any of the three initial circles could either be shrunk to a point or expanded infinitely into a line. Viète's technique, involving the utilization of simpler extreme scenarios to unravel more intricate problems, is viewed as a credible reconstruction of Apollonius' methodology. Isaac Newton further refined van Roomen's method, demonstrating the equivalence of Apollonius' quandary to determining a position based on the disparities in distances from three known points. This mathematical concept finds practical application in navigation systems such as LORAN.\n\nSubsequent mathematicians introduced algebraic methods to translate geometric predicaments into algebraic equations. Exploiting inherent symmetries within Apollonius' problem, mathematicians simplified these methods; for instance, solution circles typically exist in pairs, with one circle encompassing the given circles while the other excludes them. Utilizing this symmetry, Joseph Diaz Gergonne devised an elegant straightedge and compass resolution, while others employed geometrical transformations like circle reflections to streamline the configuration of the original circles. These advancements established a geometric framework for algebraic techniques, utilizing Lie sphere geometry, and a categorization of solutions based on 33 distinct configurations of the initial circles.\n\nThe enigmatic problem posed by Apollonius has instigated significant further exploration. Extensions to three-dimensional scenarios, such as constructing a sphere tangential to four given spheres, have been extensively studied. Particularly, the arrangement of three mutually tangent circles has garnered considerable interest. René Descartes contributed a formula relating the radii of the solution circles and the given circles, now recognized as Descartes' theorem. Iteratively solving Apollonius' problem in this context leads to the Apollonian gasket, one of the earliest fractal descriptions and significant in number theory through Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Republicans tried to repeal and replace Obamacare over the summer, they acted like “a bunch of free range chickens”, said Republican Senator John Kennedy. “Everybody was upset, tired, mad, people drawing lines in the dirt.” Not this time. Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the rest of his party’s Senate leadership brought party members into line this week and finally won passage of a sweeping tax overhaul early on Saturday. Late arm-twisting and deal-sweeteners for wavering lawmakers allowed them to push through legislation that aims to slash corporate taxes and cut personal taxes. Democrats complained it was a bad deal for middle-class and poor Americans and would irresponsibly raise the national debt by $1.4 trillion over the next decade. But they were outnumbered and Republicans’ discipline, in short supply for much of this year, saw the bill through.   The debate revealed how the Republican Party is undergoing a transformation under President Donald Trump. Republicans who fight above all for a balanced budget no longer wield the power they once had.  “I feel somewhat like a dinosaur,” deficit hawk Bob Corker admitted on Friday afternoon. Hours later, he was the only Republican to vote against the bill. Fear also played a role. The risk of a backlash from wealthy donors and conservative supporters if the party failed to deliver on another campaign promise ahead of mid-term elections next year helped party leaders get the legislation approved in a 51-49 vote. “I think after failing twice on healthcare, folks went back home and talked to the real people of America,” said Kennedy. “And they were told, ‘Look, we sent you up there to fix our problems. Fix them or we’ll find somebody who will.’” McConnell needed 50 of the 52 Republicans in the Senate to back the tax bill, knowing Vice President Mike Pence was on hand to provide the tie-breaking vote if needed. McConnell could only count on 43 votes on Wednesday night. Nine other Republican members were wobbly and he had no support from Senate Democrats.  McConnell and his allies went to work, offering a wide range  of late concessions to holdouts to get a political victory after months of frustration.  The bill still needs to be reconciled with a different version approved by the House of Representatives, but the Senate bill is expected to remain largely intact. Led by Corker and Jeff Flake, a small group of fiscal conservatives were at first upset that the Senate bill was going to increase fiscal deficits and the national debt. Early efforts to get their support went slowly. “It’s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. We’re going to keep working on it, as we always have, and we’ll get to the finish line,” Senator Orrin Hatch said on Thursday night. Flake came around when he was able to win two concessions. First, he got a commitment from Senate leadership and the Trump administration to put a time limit on allowing companies to write off the full value of new capital investments. Second, Pence assured Flake the administration would work with him on fair and permanent protections for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. Two other fiscal conservatives, James Lankford and Jerry Moran, also came on board. Although Corker refused to yield, the others’ votes were enough to ensure victory.   Senator Ron Johnson demanded and won amendments to further ease the tax burden on “pass-through” businesses. “I was just kind of biding my time ... And then Senator Portman came over and said ‘What can we do’?”, Johnson said of a Thursday night vote.     Even moderate Senator Susan Collins, who helped scuttle Obamacare repeal efforts earlier this year, agreed to vote in favor of the tax bill.  Representing voters with a high state tax burden in Maine, Collins was against her party’s plan to end the deduction of state and local property taxes. Under an amendment she pushed, taxpayers would be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 a year.  Collins also said she was assured by Republican leaders that they would take steps soon to mitigate damage caused by the repeal of a fee linked to the Obamacare “individual mandate”, which requires some Americans to buy health insurance.  McConnell also got lucky in that Trump didn’t make his job any harder. Unlike his conduct in the Obamacare debate, Trump largely stayed on message, proclaiming the tax bill would help the middle class and businesses. Although incorrect, he also claimed it would be the biggest tax cut ever. Trump met with Republican senators on Capitol Hill for lunch this week, a gathering described as thoughtful and positive. “Nobody called anybody names or talked about anybody’s native American heritage, or anything,” said Kennedy, referring to Trump’s habit of picking fights with perceived enemies. Democrats were furious, saying Republicans were throwing money at the rich and that the bill was handled too fast. “If the economy grows or shrinks. If it creates jobs or loses them. Who knows? Certainly no one here. No one could know, because it hasn’t even been read, let alone thoughtfully considered,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Shumer.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raw feelings and mistrust could pose an obstacle to President Donald Trump and hard-line conservative lawmakers in his Republican Party as they seek to rebound from defeat on healthcare legislation by launching into an overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Trump has accused the Freedom Caucus lawmakers of snatching a “defeat from the jaws of victory” with their rejection of the White House-backed healthcare bill to replace President Barack Obama’s 2010 healthcare reform bill. In interviews with 10 of the roughly three dozen House Freedom Caucus members, the lawmakers said they were eager to put aside tensions over the healthcare debacle and seek common ground on tax reform. But there is no consensus, even within the conservative faction, on details of a tax-reform bill, with some members open to discussing ideas such as the border tax plan supported by House leaders and others opposed to it. Representative Warren Davidson, a Freedom Caucus member from Ohio, said Republicans should leave aside the blame game and work through their policy differences before launching tax reform legislation. “Some people are still in that hurt-feelings and frustration” stage, Davidson said. “I do think it’s smart to take the time to get it right.” Republican Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, a Freedom Caucus lawmaker who sits on the tax-writing House of Representative Ways and Means Committee, could emerge as a bridge between the conservative faction and House leaders. The panel will work closely with House leadership on the tax bill. Schweikert said he planned to consult with rank-and-file members to discuss plans and listen to their priorities. He said giving companies incentives to invest in plants and equipment was one of the items on his own wish list. “My personal fixation is very simple: What maximizes economic growth?” Schweikert said. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said the group has “no formal position” on the structure of tax reform legislation. But Meadows listed the top priorities on his own wish list: “Lower taxes, lower taxes and lower taxes.” A 35-page blueprint developed by House Republican leaders, known as a “Better Way,” will serve as a starting point for the tax-reform discussions. The plan calls for streamlining the income tax system and cutting the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It would exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports.  The border tax proposal has divided the business community and is a top flashpoint for lawmakers. Big exporters such as General Electric Co say the tax would boost manufacturing and jobs. But retailers like Target Corp have said the border tax would hike consumer prices and hurt the economy. Trump, a businessman who had never been in public office until he took over at the White House on Jan. 20, has at times praised the border tax idea but at other times has been noncommittal. Virginia Congressman Dave Brat said he would insist that the tax bill not add to the deficit, while Meadows said he would not necessarily insist on that. Other conservatives said they needed more information about the tax bill to form an opinion - and some space from the contentious health care debate. “We just had a major battle on a Republican welfare plan and that has consumed to a large degree my time and mental effort,” said Alabama Representative Mo Brooks. “When we have a tax reform bill I can evaluate, that’s when I’ll start voting on it,” Brooks said. As a sign of tensions that have lingered after the collapse of the healthcare bill, Freedom Caucus lawmakers faced tough questioning from their colleagues during a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, said Representative Randy Weber of Texas. But Weber said some of the friction eased by the end of the meeting, prompting House Speaker Paul Ryan to say that more give and take might have been useful in the healthcare effort. “Ryan said: ‘This is what we should have been doing,’” Weber told Reuters.

{"src_passage": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Yuriko Koike says she went into politics to be a player, not a bystander. Now Tokyo s first female governor is shaking things up as her new  Party of Hope  challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office. When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.  The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,  Koike told Reuters in an interview. Koike, who defied Abe s party last year to run for governor, isn t seeking a seat in parliament s lower house herself, but is the driving force   and public face   of her upstart party. In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show. She s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now. Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan s first woman  prime minister   her pet female terrier is nicknamed  So-chan    a diminutive for  sori  or  premier  in Japanese. She has already cracked a few glass ceilings. She became the country s first female defense minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third. Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.   Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.   She s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,  said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms.  In Japan, it s subtlety within riddles, but she s blunt.  Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe s equally conservative LDP with promises to  break the fetters  of vested interest politics. She calls her party s economic policies   Yurinomics  in contrast to Abe s  Abenomics, and its platform includes  12 Zeroes  it wants to achieve, including  zero hayfever , and  zero euthanasia of unwanted pets .

Now Tokyo s first female governor is shaking things up as her new  Party of Hope  challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office. When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.  The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,  Koike told Reuters in an interview. Koike, who defied Abe s party last year to run for governor, isn t seeking a seat in parliament s lower house herself, but is the driving force   and public face   of her upstart party. In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show. She s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now. Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan s first woman  prime minister   her pet female terrier is nicknamed  So-chan    a diminutive for  sori  or  premier  in Japanese. She has already cracked a few glass ceilings. She became the country s first female defense minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third. Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.   Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.   She s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,  said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms.  In Japan, it s subtlety within riddles, but she s blunt.  Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe s equally conservative LDP with promises to  break the fetters  of vested interest politics. She calls her party s economic policies   Yurinomics  in contrast to Abe s  Abenomics, and its platform includes  12 Zeroes  it wants to achieve, including  zero hayfever , and  zero euthanasia of unwanted pets .

She is currently leading the Party of Hope, which is challenging Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition in the upcoming October 22 election. Koike, who transitioned from a television presenter to a newsmaker in response to the rapidly evolving political landscape, aims to introduce change within the Japanese political sphere rather than merely criticize from the outside. Despite not running for a seat in the lower house herself, Koike plays a pivotal role in her fledgling party, reflecting a blend of global outlook and nationalistic tendencies. Her career trajectory, marked by various positions and political affiliations, illustrates a mix of calculated risk-taking and a determined pursuit of her ambition to become Japan's first female prime minister.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON/ SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - After a rampage that left 14 people dead in San Bernardino, key U.S. lawmakers pledged to seek a law requiring technology companies to give law enforcement agencies a “back door” to encrypted communications and electronic devices, such as the iPhone used by one of the shooters. Now, only months later, much of the support is gone, and the push for legislation dead, according to sources in congressional offices, the administration and the tech sector.  Draft legislation that Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Intelligence Committee, had circulated weeks ago likely will not be introduced this year and, even if it were, would stand no chance of advancing, the sources said. Key among the problems was the lack of White House support for legislation in spite of a high-profile court showdown between the Justice Department and Apple Inc over the suspect iPhone, according to Congressional and Obama Administration officials and outside observers. “They’ve dropped anchor and taken down the sail,” former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden said. For years, the Justice Department lobbied unsuccessfully for a way to unmask suspects who “go dark,” or evade detection through coded communications in locked devices. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation took Apple to court in February to try to open the iPhone in its investigation of the San Bernardino slayings, the cause gained traction in Washington. The political landscape had shifted - or so it seemed. The short life of the push for legislation illustrates the intractable nature of the debate over digital surveillance and encryption, which has been raging in one form or another since the 1990s. Tech companies, backed by civil liberties groups, insist that building law enforcement access into phones and other devices would undermine security for everyone-including the U.S. government itself. Law enforcement agencies maintain they need a way to monitor  phone calls, emails and text messages, along with access to encrypted data. Polls show the public is split on whether the government should have access to all digital data. The legal battle between the FBI and Apple briefly united many around the idea that Congress - not the courts - should decide the issue. But the consensus was fleeting. Feinstein’s Democratic colleagues on the Intelligence Committee - along with some key Republicans - backed away. The House never got on board. The CIA and NSA were ambivalent, according to several current and former intelligence officials, in part because officials in the agencies feared any new law would interfere with their own encryption efforts. Even supporters worried that if a bill were introduced but failed, it would give Apple and other tech companies another weapon to use in future court battles. Burr had said repeatedly that legislation was imminent.     But last week, he and Feinstein told Reuters there was no timeline for the bill. Feinstein said she planned to talk to more tech stakeholders, and Burr said, “be patient.” In the meantime, tech companies have accelerated encryption efforts in the wake of the Apple case. The court showdown ended with a whimper when the FBI said it had found a way to get into the phone, and subsequently conceded privately it had found nothing of value. A week after the San Bernardino attack, Burr told Reuters passing encryption legislation was urgent because “if we don’t, we will be reading about terrorist attacks on a more frequent basis.” FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee soon after that encryption was “overwhelmingly affecting” the investigation of murders, drug trafficking and child pornography. A week later, the Justice Department persuaded a judge to issue a sweeping order demanding Apple write software to open an iPhone used by San Bernardino suspect Sayeed Farook, who died in a shootout with law enforcement. Apple fought back, arguing, among other things, that only Congressional legislation could authorize what the court was demanding. Many saw the Justice Department’s move as a way to bring pressure on Congress to act. President Obama appeared to tacitly support Comey’s court fight and the idea that there should be limits on criminal suspects’ ability to hide behind encryption. But even as the drive for legislation seemed to be gaining momentum, consensus was dissipating. Senator Lindsey Graham, an influential Republican, withdrew  support in a sudden about-face. “I was all with you until I actually started getting briefed by the people in the intel community,” Graham told Attorney General Loretta Lynch during a hearing in March. “I’m a person that’s been moved by the arguments of the precedent we set and the damage we may be doing to our own national security.” On the Democratic side, Senator Ron Wyden vowed to filibuster what he called a “dangerous proposal,” that “would leave Americans more vulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals.”  Senator Mark Warner advanced a competing bill to form a commission to study the issue.  A half dozen people familiar with the White House deliberations said they were hamstrung by a long-standing split within the Obama Administration, pitting Comey and the DOJ against technology advisors and other agencies including the Commerce and State Departments.[L2N16C1UC] They also said there was reluctance to take on the tech industry in an election year.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON/ SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Following a tragic incident in San Bernardino that resulted in the deaths of 14 individuals, influential U.S. lawmakers previously committed to enacting a law that would compel technology firms to provide law enforcement with a means to access encrypted communications and electronic devices, like the iPhone used by one of the attackers. However, recent reports indicate a significant shift in support and the abandonment of efforts to pass such legislation. According to sources within congressional offices, the government, and the technology sector, a proposed bill put forth by Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, leaders of the Intelligence Committee from both political parties, is unlikely to be formally introduced this year and would face considerable obstacles if it were. A major contributing factor was the lack of backing from the White House, despite a highly publicized legal dispute between the Justice Department and Apple Inc over the aforementioned iPhone. Noted figures within the intelligence community, such as former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden, remarked on the stalling momentum, likening it to a ship halting its progress. The debate surrounding digital surveillance and encryption, ongoing since the 1990s, illustrates the persistent complexity of the issue. While law enforcement stresses the need for access to encrypted data to combat criminal activities, tech companies and civil liberties groups argue that compromising security for the sake of government access would jeopardize everyone's safety. Amidst the back-and-forth, public opinion on government access to digital data remains divided. The standoff between the FBI and Apple initially spurred a call for legislative action instead of relying solely on judicial decisions. However, this unity was short-lived as political support dwindled, with key figures retracting their endorsements. Despite early assurances from Senator Burr about imminent legislation, recent statements indicate a lack of a defined timeline for any potential bill. Meanwhile, tech companies have ramped up their encryption efforts post the Apple case. The standoff concluded quietly after the FBI claimed to have unlocked the iPhone, revealing no valuable information. Despite initial urgency highlighted by lawmakers, the push for encryption legislation has lost steam as differing viewpoints and concerns have come to the forefront. This evolving landscape underscores the intricate nature of balancing security and privacy in the digital age."}

The Argentine pope, leader of the world s Roman Catholics, is visiting Colombia with a message of national reconciliation, as the country tries to heal the wounds left by the conflict and bitter disagreements over a peace deal agreed last year. Francis flew to the city of Villavicencio in Meta province, a vast cattle ranching area which was a hotbed of right-wing paramilitary and Marxist guerrilla violence during a conflict with successive governments. As he arrived, former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel leader Rodrigo Londono, now the head of a new political party, issued an open letter to the pope asking for forgiveness for the suffering the group inflicted.

One of the victims, Pastora Mira Garc a, told how she lost her father, husband and two children in the conflict.

His words came shortly after a prominent rebel leader requested forgiveness from the pontiff. Addressing the people of Colombia, the Pope emphasized the importance of seeking and offering forgiveness, especially in a moving gathering that united victims of the 50-year civil war with former guerrilla and paramilitary members. During his visit to Colombia, Pope Francis, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, is advocating for national reconciliation as the nation strives to mend the scars left by the conflict and contentious debates surrounding a peace accord reached last year.\n\nArriving in Villavicencio, located in the Meta province known for past violent confrontations between paramilitary groups and Marxist guerrillas, Pope Francis was met with a warm reception from the community. The former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel leader, Rodrigo Londono, also known as Timochenko, publicly asked for forgiveness from the Pope for the suffering inflicted by the group. Londono expressed remorse in an open letter to Pope Francis, acknowledging the pain caused to the Colombian people. The Pope's visit to Villavicencio included a poignant prayer meeting attended by around 6,000 survivors of the conflict, where personal stories of pain and forgiveness were shared.\n\nThe Pope listened to emotional testimonies, including that of a woman who joined a paramilitary group as a teenager, a former FARC guerrilla, and two victims of the conflict between the guerrillas and paramilitary forces. The crowd applauded as a victim, Pastora Mira García, spoke about her losses and emphasized the need for forgiveness to end the cycle of violence, stating she was now able to forgive the unforgivable. In a symbolic gesture, a damaged statue of Jesus Christ recovered from a church attacked by the FARC in 2002 was displayed on the stage as a reminder of the enduring suffering caused by the war.\n\nReflecting on the conflict that has claimed over 220,000 lives and displaced millions since the 1960s, the Pope called for healing and reconciliation. He acknowledged the challenge of accepting former combatants back into society but stressed the importance of extending forgiveness to those who show genuine repentance and seek to make amends. Before leaving Villavicencio, Pope Francis paused to pray at the Reconciliation Cross, a memorial honoring the war's victims, and planted a tree as a symbol of peace.\n\nThe Pope also presided over a Mass where Pedro María Ramírez, a priest killed in 1948 during a period of political violence, and Bishop Jesús Emilio Jaramillo, assassinated in 1989, were beatified. Both figures suffered violence for their beliefs and actions, serving as reminders of the turbulent history of Colombia."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats on Sunday criticized the lack of women on a working group in the Republican-led Senate that will craft a plan to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. As the Senate begins to wrestle with a Republican healthcare bill narrowly approved by the House of Representatives last week, senators questioned why the 13-member working group put together by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell does not include any of the chamber’s five Republican women. “Women’s health is a big part of this and women are a majority of the population, and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform,” Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington wrote on Twitter: “It matters to have women at the table — and it matters when they aren’t.” Republicans pushed their healthcare restructuring through the House on a 217-213 vote, handing President Donald Trump his first major legislative success. But the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow majority and several members have suggested they will develop their own plans. Democrats are united in opposition to the House bill. Trump pledged on Sunday that the effort to gut former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law would be successful. “Republican Senators will not let the American People down!,” he wrote on Twitter. “ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up-it was a lie and it is dead!” The Senate’s healthcare working group includes the Republican leadership, several committee chairmen and a combination of conservatives such as Ted Cruz of Texas and more moderate Republicans from politically important swing states such as Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Critics said the group’s lack of diversity would eliminate crucial viewpoints. “The GOP is crafting policy on an issue that directly impacts women without including a single woman in the process. It’s wrong,” Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California wrote on Twitter on Saturday. Don Stewart, a senior aide to McConnell, said critics were getting “hung up on process” while ignoring the problems of Obamacare such as higher costs and limited choices. “So you can get caught up in process, or you can focus on the actual reality,” Stewart said in an email on Sunday. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who has been working on her own healthcare plan, said she was reaching out to moderate Democrats to try to find common ground. She did not criticize the working group’s all-male make-up but said she wanted to see a broader effort to replace Obama’s 2010 healthcare law. “I would like to see us put together a bipartisan group to solve this problem, of Democrats who acknowledge there are problems with the current law, that it is not working well in several states, and Republicans who also want to make sure that we’re not reducing coverage and we’re giving flexibility,” Collins said on ABC’s “This Week.” Senators have questioned aspects of the House bill, which would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of its expansion during the Obama administration. It also would allow states to opt out of some existing protections for people with pre-existing health conditions. While insurers could not deny insurance because of such conditions, they would be allowed to decide how much to charge. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the most moderate Democrats in the Senate, said his state “gets absolutely slammed” in the House bill because it has a lot of elderly residents and people with pre-existing conditions. “I just want to work and sit down and try to get something done, but no one’s asked us,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program. “Our congressional delegation says, ‘don’t worry, the Senate will fix it.’ And no one has asked any Democrat. And I am the most centrist.” White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the White House would not dictate the process. “I think we want to let them do their work, let them work this out.

{"src_passage": " (This Oct. 9 story has been refiled to add a dropped word in the headline) By Sonya Dowsett BILBAO, Spain (Reuters) - As Spain and Catalonia head toward a constitutional collision over the region s claim to independence, lawmakers on both sides of the crisis are pointing to a way out: north, to Basque Country. Among the verdant mountains of Basque Country, which borders France, a once-violent campaign for independence has petered out, with generous fiscal autonomy from Madrid helping to keep popular agitation for independence in check.  We don t have that economic resentment,  Aitor Esteban, organizer for the Basque National Party in Spain s parliament, told Reuters in an interview at party headquarters in Bilbao.  People don t feel that need to act upon a grievance about money; that makes a big difference.  The Catalan government is not calling for a Basque-style deal, insisting instead on independence after declaring overwhelming support for secession in an Oct. 1 referendum banned by Madrid. But the most moderate lawmakers in the region s ruling coalition privately say they could drop independence claims if they were given the tax autonomy that Basque Country enjoys. In Madrid, some socialists have suggested it could serve as a model for a compromise that would defuse Spain s biggest political crisis since a failed coup in 1981, although the cost to the central government would be significant. Basque staged modest protests over Madrid s violent crackdown on Catalonia s referendum, but the crisis has failed to rekindle secessionist fervor on the streets of Bilbao, the Basque capital nestled on the banks of the Nervion.

Basque militant group ETA, which killed more than 850 people in a decades-long campaign to carve out a separate state, effectively ended its armed resistance this year when it surrendered its weapons. The region now has one of the highest economic outputs per capita and one of the lowest unemployment rates in Spain.

Basque s fiscal autonomy is among the most generous of any region in Europe, dating back to the 19th century and enshrined in Spain s 1978 constitution. If it were to be extended to Catalonia, an economically more powerful region accounting for a fifth of national production, the Spanish state would lose about 16 billion euros, according to a 2014 study by research house CSIC. That would equal about 13 percent of next year s budget and affect Spain s deficit and borrowing costs. For that reason, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has ruled out such generous treatment for Catalonia. Under Basque s accord with Madrid, the region collects nearly all its own taxes, which are forecast to total 13 billion euros ($15 billion) this year. It is due to return 800 million euros to Madrid in what is known as an annual quota to cover the costs of national expenses such as defense or infrastructure. Rajoy has sweetened that arrangement since he regained power at the head of a minority government last year, as the price of securing Basque National Party support for his 2017 budget. It has proved unpopular with other regions who would almost certainly oppose any similar deal for Catalonia, as it would mean cutting their share of state revenue. Typically, regions pass taxes to Madrid which redistributes money back to them according to a formula that favors the poorer regions. Former Catalan leader Artur Mas tried to hold talks with Rajoy in 2012 about granting Catalonia powers to raise and spend its own taxes, but the prospect of negotiations in the current climate look bleak. Catalonia has long said it pays a disproportionate level of taxes to Madrid in relation to the central funding it receives. A study backed by the Budget Ministry says Catalonia pays to the state 9.9 billion euros more than it receives. The Catalan economy ministry says this is even higher. Economists say an overhaul of the fiscal relationship between Madrid and the regions is overdue because the current system has led to intense tax competition between regions.

Among the verdant mountains of Basque Country, which borders France, a once-violent campaign for independence has petered out, with generous fiscal autonomy from Madrid helping to keep popular agitation for independence in check.  We don t have that economic resentment,  Aitor Esteban, organizer for the Basque National Party in Spain s parliament, told Reuters in an interview at party headquarters in Bilbao.  People don t feel that need to act upon a grievance about money; that makes a big difference.  The Catalan government is not calling for a Basque-style deal, insisting instead on independence after declaring overwhelming support for secession in an Oct. 1 referendum banned by Madrid. But the most moderate lawmakers in the region s ruling coalition privately say they could drop independence claims if they were given the tax autonomy that Basque Country enjoys. In Madrid, some socialists have suggested it could serve as a model for a compromise that would defuse Spain s biggest political crisis since a failed coup in 1981, although the cost to the central government would be significant. Basque staged modest protests over Madrid s violent crackdown on Catalonia s referendum, but the crisis has failed to rekindle secessionist fervor on the streets of Bilbao, the Basque capital nestled on the banks of the Nervion. Catalan flags hang from balconies alongside the Basque flag in a sign of solidarity, but Bilbao is prosperous and peaceful.

", "predictions": "Refiled on October 9 to include a missing word in the title, this news piece by Sonya Dowsett from Bilbao, Spain (Reuters) discusses the escalating tensions between Spain and Catalonia regarding the latter's bid for independence. Lawmakers from both sides are eyeing a potential solution in the north - the Basque Country. The Basque region, nestled among lush mountains bordering France, has managed to quell its once-violent push for independence, largely due to its significant fiscal autonomy from Madrid. Aitor Esteban, a representative of the Basque National Party in Spain's parliament, highlighted the absence of economic grievances as a key factor in keeping independence aspirations at bay in Basque Country. While Catalonia is firm on pursuing independence post a banned referendum on October 1, some moderate voices within its ruling coalition hint at dropping independence claims if granted the tax autonomy enjoyed by Basque Country. Madrid is urged to consider the Basque model as a potential compromise to diffuse the escalating political crisis sparked by Catalonia's referendum. Basque Country, which had its share of unrest in the past, now showcases peace and prosperity in the streets of Bilbao. The region's fiscal independence, granted since the 19th century and embedded in Spain's constitution, has been a cornerstone of its stability and economic success. Any extension of similar autonomy to Catalonia, a major economic powerhouse in Spain, could have significant fiscal implications for the central government. However, with mounting pressure and calls for reform, the ongoing debate around fiscal autonomy and the fair distribution of resources among Spain's regions might see some resolution in the near future."}

The U.S. Senate members also said they were disturbed by a “violent and disproportionate” security response to Rohingya militant attacks that have driven more than 600,000 people from Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh. Human rights monitors have accused Myanmar’s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless Rohingya during so-called clearance operations following insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. Myanmar’s government has denied most of the claims, and the army last week said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. “We are not hearing of any violations going on at the moment,” Suu Kyi told reporters in response to a question about human rights abuses at the end of the Asia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM, in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw. “We can’t say whether it has happened or not. As a responsibility of the government, we have to make sure that it won’t happen.” Nobel laureate Suu Kyi said she hoped talks with Bangladesh’s foreign minister this week would lead to a deal on the “safe and voluntary return” of those who have fled. Suu Kyi’s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar’s transition to power after decades of military rule. While a top UN official has described the military’s actions as a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on a visit to Myanmar last week refused to label it as such. In early November, U.S. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on Myanmar military officials. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, who was among the sponsors of the legislation introduced in the Senate, led a congressional delegation that visited Rakhine this week, but was blocked from traveling to the violence-hit north of the state and to Rohingya camps. The group also traveled to Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh, where Rohingya refugees are huddled into makeshift camps and fed by overstretched aid agencies. “Many refugees have suffered direct attacks including loved ones, children and husbands being killed in front of them, wives and daughters being raped, burns and other horrific injuries. This has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing,” Merkley told reporters in Myanmar on Tuesday. “We are profoundly disturbed by the violent and disproportionate response against the Rohingya by the military and local groups,” he said. The delegation called for Myanmar to allow an investigation into the alleged atrocities that would involve the international community. “We want to emphasize that the world is watching,” Merkley said, adding that it was important Myanmar allow anyone who wants to come back to return to their homes and their farms. Merkley said the delegation was “not here today to recommend…what the U.S. government would do or should do,” when asked about the legislation introduced in the Congress. Myanmar officials have so far said they plan to resettle most returnees in new “model villages”, rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the United Nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps. “Individuals cannot be coming back…simply to return to camps where there would be continued discrimination, restrictions on full participation in the economy and society,” said Merkley. He warned that isolating people in camps creates a “two-tier society that is fundamentally incompatible with the future of democracy and it guarantees perpetuation of suspicions and misunderstandings and conflicts.” Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Suu Kyi said discussions would be held with the Bangladesh foreign minister on Wednesday and Thursday about repatriation. Officials from both countries began talks last month on how to process the Rohingya wanting to return. “We hope that this would result in an MOU signed quickly, which would enable us to start the safe and voluntarily return of all of those who have gone across the border,” Suu Kyi said. The Rohingya are largely stateless and many people in Myanmar view them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Suu Kyi said Myanmar would follow the framework of an  agreement reached in the 1990s to cover the earlier repatriation of Rohingya, who had fled to Bangladesh to escape previous bouts of ethnic violence. That agreement did not address the citizenship status of Rohingya, and Bangladesh has been pressing for a repatriation process that provided Rohingya with more safeguards this time. “It’s on the basis of residency...this was agreed by the two governments long time ago with success, so this will be formula we will continue to follow,” Suu Kyi said.

Allegations of atrocities, including mass rape, by Myanmar's military against the Rohingya during operations following insurgent attacks have been reported by human rights observers. However, Myanmar's government has refuted most of these claims, with the army stating that their internal investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. \"At present, we are not receiving reports of any ongoing violations,\" Suu Kyi told reporters when asked about human rights abuses at the conclusion of the Asia-Europe Meeting in Myanmar's capital, Naypyitaw.

Merkley, speaking in Myanmar, stated, “Many refugees have experienced direct attacks such as witnessing loved ones, children, and spouses being killed, women and daughters being subjected to assault, and suffering severe injuries. These incidents are highly suggestive of ethnic cleansing.” He emphasized the delegation's profound concern over the military's harsh and disproportionate response to the Rohingya, calling for an international investigation into the reported atrocities. Merkley stressed that Myanmar must permit the return of all those who wish to go back to their homes and farms. Suu Kyi disclosed plans to hold talks with the Bangladeshi foreign minister regarding repatriation and expressed hopes for a swift agreement to enable the safe and voluntary return of the displaced individuals. The Rohingya, who are predominantly stateless, are often viewed as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh by many in Myanmar.

The documents indicate that Veselnitskaya represented the FSB in a legal dispute over ownership of a luxury property in northwest Moscow from 2005 to 2013. The FSB, which succeeded the Soviet-era KGB and was previously led by Vladimir Putin before he became the Russian president, was the agency Veselnitskaya represented in the case. While there is no direct evidence suggesting Veselnitskaya is connected to the Russian government or intelligence services, her previous representation of the FSB may raise inquiries among some U.S. politicians. The Obama administration had sanctioned the FSB in the past for alleged involvement in election hacking, a claim Russia denies. Republican Senator Charles Grassley expressed concerns about Veselnitskaya's entry into the United States. Veselnitskaya was involved in representing a Russian client accused of money laundering by U.S. prosecutors, a case settled earlier this year after a lengthy legal battle. Veselnitskaya did not respond to queries regarding her work for the FSB but later shared a post on her Facebook page challenging the media's findings. She claimed to have represented various Russian businessmen, citizens, and companies defending against state accusations, as well as having U.S. clients. The FSB declined to comment when approached by Reuters. Efforts to determine when and by whom the lawsuit, dating back to at least 2003, was initiated were unsuccessful. Documents indicate that Veselnitskaya and her firm represented \"military unit 55002\" in the property dispute, where the FSB, the Russian domestic intelligence agency, had a connection. Veselnitskaya, who later met with Donald Trump Jr., insisted she was a private lawyer and not a Russian government attorney providing compromising information about Hillary Clinton. The complex case Veselnitskaya handled for the FSB involved appeals courts ruling against the FSB's attempts to evict private companies from the contested property. An individual previously employed by a company evicted from the building shared insights with Reuters, stating the FSB took control of the premises in 2008. The property was privatized following the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, but the Russian government contended in the lawsuit Veselnitskaya worked on that the building had been unlawfully sold to private entities. Some of the businesses mentioned in court records are no longer operational, with those still active being relatively obscure companies in the electric components industry. Elektronintorg, an electronic components supplier now occupying the building, is owned by state conglomerate Rostec, overseen by Sergei Chemezov, who, like Putin, had KGB background and served with him in East Germany. Rostec clarified that although Elektronintorg legally registered its address at the building, its staff primarily operated from a different location.

When dealing with a separable issue and its optimal solution, we establish a specific optimal solution xmin = ( x1 , ... , xN ) min with the lowest value f ( xmin ) . In this scenario, we also look at an optimal solution ( xmin , f ( xmin ) ) for the \"convexified problem\" where the convex hulls of the summand functions are considered. Such an optimal solution serves as the limit of a sequence of points within the convexified problem\n( xj , f ( xj ) ) â âˆ‘ Conv ( Graph ( fn ) ) .\nEssentially, the provided optimal point consists of a combination of points from the original summand graphs and a few convexified summands, as outlined by the Shapley-Folkman lemma. This study was presented by Ivar Ekeland in 1974 to clarify the seeming convexity of separable problems with multiple summands, despite the non-convex nature of the individual summand problems. In 1973, the young mathematician Claude LemarÃ©chal achieved unexpected success using convex minimization techniques on problems known to be non-convex. For nonlinear problems, the solution to the dual problem may not always offer valuable insight into solving the primal problem, unless the primal problem is convex and meets certain qualification constraints. LemarÃ©chal's problem was additive and each summand function was non-convex, yet a solution to the dual problem yielded a close estimate of the optimal value for the primal problem. Ekeland's analysis shed light on the efficacy of convex minimization methods in handling large, separable problems despite the non-convexities of the summand functions. Ekeland and later researchers argued that additive separability creates an approximately convex composite problem, even in the presence of non-convex summand functions. The pivotal aspect in these publications is the utilization of the Shapley-Folkman lemma. This lemma has promoted the application of convex minimization techniques in various contexts involving the summation of numerous functions.\n\n= = = Probability and measure theory = = =\n\nConvex sets are commonly explored in conjunction with probability theory. Each point within the convex hull of a non-empty subset Q in a finite-dimensional space represents the expected value of a simple random vector that ranges in Q, thanks to CarathÃ©odory's lemma. Therefore, for a non-empty set Q, the set of expected values from simple Q-valued random vectors equals the convex hull of Q; this equivalence demonstrates the relevance of the Shapley-Folkman-Starr results in probability theory. Conversely, probability theory offers tools to analyze convex sets in general and the Shapley-Folkman-Starr results specifically. These results have found extensive application in the probabilistic study of random sets, such as in proving laws of large numbers, central limit theorems, and large-deviation principles. These probabilistic limit theorems leverage the Shapley-Folkman-Starr results to avoid the necessity for all random sets to be convex.\nA probability measure acts as a finite measure, and the Shapley-Folkman lemma holds significance beyond probabilistic measure theory, extending into the realms of volume theory and vector measures. This lemma allows for a more nuanced interpretation of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, which governs the volume of sums relative to the volumes of their constituent sets. Set volume is defined concerning the Lebesgue measure, applied to subsets of Euclidean space. In advanced measure theory, the Shapley-Folkman lemma has been instrumental in proving Lyapunov's theorem, which asserts the convexity of the range of a vector measure. In this context, the term \"range\" (alternatively known as \"image\") refers to the set of values produced by a function. A vector measure serves as a vector-valued extension of a measure; for instance, if p1 and p2 represent probability measures on the same measurable space, the product function p1 p2 acts as a vector measure, calculated for every event Ï as\n( p1 p2 ) ( Ï ) = ( p1 ( Ï ) , p2 ( Ï ) ) .\nLyapunov's theorem has found application in economics, \"bang-bang\" control theory, and statistical analysis. It is often described as a continuous counterpart to the Shapley-Folkman lemma, which is, in turn, considered a discrete analogy to Lyapunov's theorem."}

France intervened in Mali to ward off an offensive by Islamist militants that began in 2012, and 4,000 of its troops remain in the region as part of Operation Barkhane where they work alongside 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Mali. France and West African countries are pushing for the creation of a regional force known as the G5 Sahel.   Washington provides bilateral assistance, intelligence and training for regional security operations. But it is cool towards the African force and has pushed back against U.N. support for it. President Donald Trump s administration has also come under intense scrutiny over its existing operations in West Africa after an ambush in Niger in early October saw four U.S. soldiers killed by jihadists, in what experts say appears to have been an intelligence failure.  In the Sahel, France is deploying in a high-intensity environment, with tremendous support from the United States. We are immensely grateful for that support,  French Defence Minister Florence Parly said in a speech at a Washington think tank monitored in Paris.  But much more needs to be done. We can t be, and don t want to be, the praetorian (guards) of sovereign African countries. They must be made able to defeat terror on their own,  she said during a visit for meetings with her American counterpart James Mattis and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.  I would be happy if you could help spread the word in the Beltway,  she said in a reference to the U.S. government. Still, discussion in Washington was focused more on what went wrong with the Niger operation. The deadly incident has become a political football in Washington amid criticism of Trump s handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers.  The U.S. military is investigating the incident, and the FBI said it was assisting  as it has done in the past when American citizens are killed overseas.    Hours after Parly s visit to the Pentagon, Mattis visited Capitol Hill to meet Senator John McCain, who threatened to issue a subpoena to get information about the ambush in Niger after complaining about being kept in the dark.  After their talks, Mattis acknowledged that  we can always improve on communication,  remarks echoed by McCain, the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  We have had our problems and issues. But I m proud to work with him, and I m proud of the work that he is doing,  McCain said. From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles. Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead. French aircraft evacuated the wounded, but the body of one of the dead soldiers was recovered by Nigerien soldiers only after two days. The U.S. military s Africa Command issued a statement on Friday explaining that the 800 U.S. military personnel in Niger were on a mission supporting African forces.  The U.S. military does not have an active, direct combat mission in Niger,  it said.  LONG-TERM  EXIT STRATEGY? Parly said the G5 Sahel force was meant to bolster the security capacity of Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania, which are all former French colonies.  French officials see the success of the G5 Sahel as a long-term exit strategy for Paris. For decades, France has mounted military operations in its former African colonies but in recent years it has looked to spread the cost. Until now the G5 force has only received a quarter of its estimated 423 million euro budget, according to a report by the U.N.

", "predictions": "PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - France's defense minister cautioned that the United States needs to enhance its backing for a proposed African force tasked with combating Islamist extremists in West Africa. Failure to do so could result in French troops shouldering the burden alone. Following France's intervention in Mali in 2012 to repel Islamist militants, 4,000 troops are still stationed in the region as part of Operation Barkhane, working alongside 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers. France, along with West African nations, is advocating for the establishment of a regional force known as the G5 Sahel. While Washington offers bilateral aid, intelligence, and training for regional security efforts, it has displayed reservation towards the African force and opposed U.N. endorsement. In a recent address at a Washington think tank, French Defense Minister Florence Parly expressed gratitude for the significant support provided by the United States in the Sahel region but stressed the necessity for more concerted efforts. Parly emphasized the need for African nations to independently combat terrorism, rather than relying solely on external assistance. During her visit for discussions with U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, Parly called for increased awareness within the U.S. government. Despite the focus in Washington on the Niger operation's shortcomings, including the tragic loss of four U.S. soldiers, discussions surrounding the incident have become politicized. Investigations by the U.S. military and FBI are ongoing. Parly views the G5 Sahel force as crucial for enhancing the security capabilities of several African countries, which are former French colonies. French officials regard the success of the G5 Sahel as a strategic long-term solution, allowing for a gradual reduction of French military presence in the region. The force, which has only received a fraction of its required budget, is gearing up for its initial operations soon. Parly urged for robust U.N. backing and hoped for widespread support, with the aim of garnering additional aid at an upcoming donor conference in December."}

However, Baghdad insists that any talks are contingent upon the Kurds affirming Iraq's unity. The Kurds, who have long aspired for independence, viewed the referendum as a precursor to negotiations leading to independence through an agreement with the Iraqi government. However, Baghdad, with support from Turkey and Iran, continues to oppose Kurdish secession.

Following is a collection of quotes from select policy speeches he has delivered since 2015: On Rates:  “The financial crisis did significant damage to the productive capacity of our economy, and the damage was of a character, extent, and duration that cannot be fully known today…It seems plausible that at least part of this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained growth.4 To encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing accommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets are tightening or other supply-side constraints are binding.” - April 2015 speech to New York Council on Foreign Relations: (Graphic: U.S. labor market measures vs interest rates - reut.rs/2h7hsFx) On Financial Stability:  “The bottom line is that there has not been an excessive buildup of leverage, maturity transformation, or broadly unsustainable asset prices…Overall, I do not see leveraged finance markets as posing undue financial stability risks.

During his tenure as a Fed Governor, Powell has maintained a moderate stance, aligning with Yellen's approach of gradually increasing interest rates to support labor market recovery and ensuring financial stability through regulations. Here are excerpts from some of his key speeches: Regarding Interest Rates: Powell emphasized the long-lasting impact of the financial crisis on the economy, suggesting that sustained growth could help reverse the damage, and advocated for cautious rate hikes. On Financial Stability: He noted the absence of excessive financial risks and highlighted the Fed's role in maintaining stability without intervening in market risk-taking. In terms of Regulations: Powell discussed the increased requirements for banks, acknowledging the costs but emphasizing the long-term benefits for economic growth. Addressing the Current Economic Outlook: Powell expressed a balanced view of the global and domestic economic landscape, highlighting the improved conditions and advocating for gradual rate increases. As Powell moves towards confirmation, he may face questions about maintaining the current interest payment system for banks and the use of monetary policy rules. On Reserve Interest: Powell praised the simplicity and effectiveness of the current system of paying interest on bank reserves. On Policy Rules: He opposed the idea of strict policy rules, emphasizing the need for systematic but not rigid monetary policy approaches."}

Located just 25 light-years away from Earth, Vega, along with Arcturus and Sirius, stands out as one of the most luminous stars near the Sun. Astronomers have extensively studied Vega, considering it to be a significant star, often referred to as the \"next most important star after the Sun.\" In ancient times, Vega served as the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will resume this position around 13,727 AD, with a declination of +86°14'. Notably, Vega holds the distinction of being the first star, other than the Sun, to be photographed and to have its spectrum recorded. Its distance was among the first to be estimated through parallax measurements, serving as a foundational reference for calibrating the brightness scale. Vega's composition, age, and variability have intrigued astronomers, with its rapid rotation causing a distinct temperature variation across its surface.\n\nObserving history of Vega dates back to the mid-19th century, marking significant milestones in astrophotography. In 1840, John William Draper captured the Moon using the daguerreotype process, pioneering celestial photography. Subsequently, in 1850, William Bond and John Adams Whipple at the Harvard College Observatory photographed Vega, making it the first star (besides the Sun) to be imaged. This photograph revealed Vega's spectrum, with Henry Draper later capturing the star's absorption lines, showcasing similarities with the Sun's spectrum. Vega's spectrum has played a crucial role as a reference point for classifying other stars since the mid-20th century. Determining Vega's distance relied on parallax measurements against background stars, a method initially scrutinized but later refined to align closely with modern estimates. As a standard for measuring stellar brightness, Vega historically represented magnitude zero in all wavelengths, impacting the calibration of brightness scales. However, contemporary practices opt for a more standardized approach, defining the zero point based on specific flux values for greater convenience in calibration processes. Vega's significance extends to the UBV photometric system, where it, among a group of A0V stars, established the initial mean values for this system in the 1950s."}

{"src_passage": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean public support for nuclear power on Friday sucker punched a government policy to steer the country away from nuclear-generated electricity as Seoul said it would bow to a demand to resume construction of two new reactors.  President Moon Jae-in came to power in May, after running  on a ticket that called for reducing South Korea s nuclear and coal-fired power generation in a push to use more natural gas and renewables.  Those plans were dealt an unlooked-for blow on Friday when a public opinion survey found a majority of almost 60 percent in favour of resuming the stalled construction of two reactors.  Building the two reactors could mean reversal of a strategy to slowly reduce nuclear energy s share of the power mix, and also significantly eat into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand of the world s second-largest consumer of the fuel.   Our recommendation to the government is restarting construction,  said Kim Ji-hyung, chairman of a government-organised committee to study the nuclear projects.   Our final public opinion survey showed 59.5 percent of (responding) South Koreans chose to resume the construction,  Kim told a news conference.  Stability of power supply was cited as a primary reason for the choice in survey responses, the committee said.  We respect the will of the committee,  said South Korea s presidential office spokesman Park Soo-hyun.  An expert at a government think tank said the size of the win in favour of the projects meant the government had no choice but to go with the committee s recommendation.   The outcome was very unexpected ... Many expected the difference would be a maximum 10 percentage points, but as it turned out, it stood nearly at 20,  said Roh Dong-seok, senior research fellow at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.  The two 1,400-megawatt (MW) reactors - Shin Kori No.5 and Shin Kori No.6 - were originally to be completed by March 2021 and March 2022, respectively, in the southeastern city of Ulsan. The government announced a suspension of the projects after coming to power, saying it would consult the public over their future.  The committee conducted four rounds of surveys, including phone interviews of 20,006 people and public discussions involving some 470 citizens, over the past three months. With the reactors now likely going ahead, completion dates are set for October 2021 and October 2022, according to state-run nuclear operator Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power [KRHYDR.UL]. (For a graphic on 'South Korea 2016 power generation mix' click reut.rs/2xTOZKB)      Shares of Korea Electric Power Corp rose 0.6 percent to 41,110 won ($36.32) on Friday, after jumping nearly 6 percent following the announcement of the survey results.      KEPCO Engineering & Construction, in charge of the reactors  design, lost 1.2 percent after surging as much as 20 percent. KEPCO Plant Service & Engineering gained 1.7 percent.  Building nuclear power plants takes years, so the decision in favour of the two new reactors will not change South Korea s immediate fuel demand patterns.  But the vote, which surprised many in the industry, does impact the long-term outlook for the country s fuel consumption, with the biggest impact likely falling on imports of LNG.   Full implementation of Moon s election promises could have resulted in around 10 million tonnes (a year) of extra LNG demand by 2030. This now seems unlikely,  said Kiah Wei Giam, principal analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  That compares to South Korea s LNG imports of 33.4 million tonnes last year, according to customs data. [LNG/KRTRD] Giam said, however, the survey did not totally derail the government s energy policies.   With the planned nuclear phase-out delayed, it will be interesting to see whether more aggressive anti-coal policies are enacted,  Giam said.  Park Won-joo, Deputy Minister for Energy & Resources, said later at a briefing the government will reach a final decision on the nuclear reactors next Tuesday and then tell the state-run nuclear operator when to resume project construction.

But the vote, which surprised many in the industry, does impact the long-term outlook for the country s fuel consumption, with the biggest impact likely falling on imports of LNG.   Full implementation of Moon s election promises could have resulted in around 10 million tonnes (a year) of extra LNG demand by 2030. This now seems unlikely,  said Kiah Wei Giam, principal analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  That compares to South Korea s LNG imports of 33.4 million tonnes last year, according to customs data. [LNG/KRTRD] Giam said, however, the survey did not totally derail the government s energy policies.   With the planned nuclear phase-out delayed, it will be interesting to see whether more aggressive anti-coal policies are enacted,  Giam said.  Park Won-joo, Deputy Minister for Energy & Resources, said later at a briefing the government will reach a final decision on the nuclear reactors next Tuesday and then tell the state-run nuclear operator when to resume project construction.  ", "predictions": "Paraphrased Passage:\nPublic opinion in South Korea unexpectedly shifted towards supporting nuclear power on Friday, contradicting the government's plan to move away from nuclear energy. Despite President Moon Jae-in's initial goal of reducing the country's reliance on nuclear and coal power in favor of natural gas and renewable sources, a recent survey revealed that nearly 60 percent of respondents favored resuming the construction of two new reactors. This decision could potentially reverse the strategy of decreasing nuclear power in the energy mix and impact the demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the country. The chairman of the committee studying the nuclear projects recommended restarting construction based on the overwhelming support from the public survey. The primary reason cited by respondents for supporting the reactors was the stability of the power supply. Consequently, the government is now expected to follow the committee's recommendation and proceed with the construction of the Shin Kori No.5 and Shin Kori No.6 reactors. This outcome has significant implications for South Korea's energy future, especially in relation to LNG imports. The government will make a final decision on the nuclear reactors next week, potentially reshaping the country's energy policies going forward."}

Trump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. Pressure is growing on the businessman-turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months. In one of the few visits he has made to the U.S. Capitol since taking office two months ago, Trump told fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives on Tuesday morning they would face “political problems” for opposing the bill that takes apart Obamacare and partially replaces it. Later in the day, Trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the Oval Office to listen to their concerns. “The president was really clear: He laid it on the line for everybody,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading proponent of the bill, told reporters. “We made a promise. Now is our time to keep that promise. ... If we don’t keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this.” The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1 percent in their worst one-day performances since before Trump’s election victory on Nov. 8. The S&P financial index sank 2.87 percent, its biggest daily fall since June. “You have this back and forth in Congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan can’t pass, then they can’t move on to taxes. There’s this feeling that if things don’t get done, then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up,” said Mark Kepner, managing director at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.  Some conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough, while moderate Republicans worry that millions of Americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. (For a graphic on how U.S. healthcare stacks up under the ACA and AHCA click tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)  Party leaders hope to move the bill to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday. But the administration and House leadership can afford to lose only about 20 Republican votes or risk the bill failing since Democrats are united against it. Republican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc. As many as 21 currently plan to vote no on the legislation, according to a CNN report. Republican Representative Walter Jones said Trump told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting at the Capitol that if the Republican bill does not pass, they would face “political problems.” Jones said he thought Trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was one of Trump’s main campaign promises and has been a goal of Republicans since it was enacted.  While Trump predicted that Republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the 2018 midterm elections if they do not gut Obamacare, there is also danger to them in doing so. If the Republican bill is passed, millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that 14 million people would forfeit coverage under the House bill over the next year, although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation.  Nancy Nielsen, associate dean for health policy at the University at Buffalo’s Jacobs School of Medicine, said Republican leaders were in a tough spot. “It is a not-so-delicate balancing act, as they have to win over the most conservative House and Senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election,” Nielsen said.  Democrats oppose the Republicans’ plan, saying it would hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.     Republican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics, mainly from their own party.  Republican chairmen for two key committees said late Monday they proposed more funding for tax credits, which conservatives have opposed, that would give the Senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance. Additionally, Obamacare’s taxes would be eliminated in 2017 instead of 2018. The amendments also addressed Medicaid, which is the country’s largest health insurance program and covers about 70 million people, mostly the poor. The changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults, an idea championed by many conservatives, and to decide how they receive federal funds.     Congressman Dan Donovan, who attended the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, said Trump did “more listening than directing.” There was some “political talk” but “no threats,” he said. Donovan, who has not announced whether he will support the bill, cited people losing Medicaid and the defunding of women’s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood as concerns in his New York district.  The Club for Growth, an influential conservative lobby group, said it would spend at least $500,000 for ads on television and digital platforms urging Congress members to defeat the bill. The Senate also will vote on the legislation, and more changes could be made.

", "predictions": "In an effort to dismantle Obamacare, President Donald Trump sought to garner support from Republican lawmakers on Tuesday amidst a dip in U.S. stock markets, marking the worst single-day performance since the November election. Trump is striving to secure a victory in his initial major legislative endeavor as pressure mounts for him to fulfill his promises, amid concerns from investors that a failed healthcare overhaul could signal obstacles for planned tax cuts and deregulation that have bolstered the market to record levels recently. Trump, during a rare visit to the U.S. Capitol since assuming office, warned House Republicans about potential political repercussions if they oppose the bill to repeal parts of Obamacare. Following this, Trump held discussions with a group of lawmakers in the Oval Office to address their apprehensions. House Speaker Paul Ryan emphasized the importance of upholding their commitment, stating that failure to do so would pose challenges. Stock indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average registered over a 1% decline, marking their worst performance since before Trump's election win. The uncertainty surrounding the healthcare plan's progress in Congress is affecting market anticipations for future endeavors like tax reforms. While some conservative members find the proposed healthcare bill insufficient, moderate Republicans fear the repercussions on millions of Americans. Party leaders aim to advance the bill for deliberation on the House floor, targeting Thursday for the debate. The bill's fate hangs in the balance as the administration and House leadership can only afford a limited number of Republican defections since Democrats are set against it. Despite facing pressure from Trump and the party, some Republican members, including Congressman Meadows, are leaning towards rejecting the legislation. Repealing and replacing Obamacare has been a key campaign pledge for Trump and a longstanding objective for Republicans. The healthcare bill amendments made by Republican leaders aim to appease critics, particularly within their party, by proposing additional funding for tax credits and advancing the timeline for eliminating Obamacare taxes. The changes also address Medicaid and include provisions for states to tailor the program to their needs. As the bill faces scrutiny and opposition from various quarters, including influential lobby groups like the Club for Growth, the Senate's stance remains crucial, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicating readiness to take up the bill if approved by the House."}
{"src_passage": "(Reuters) - WikiLeaks, the website that specializes in exposing secrets, released thousands of documents that described internal U.S. Central Intelligence Agency discussions on hacking techniques it  used between 2013 and 2016 to circumvent security on electronic devices for spying.  U.S. officials said on Wednesday that CIA contractors were the likely source of the leak. The following are some questions and answers users of consumer electronics may have: Q: How many of the vulnerabilities described in the Wikileaks document are still open to exploit by hackers or spies? A: There is no definitive answer in the documents, which describe attack techniques but often do not give enough detail for even the device and software vendors to understand fully how their products were targeted and close the security holes. Software updates have solved many of the flaws but it is unclear how many remain. In a chart of exploits for Apple’s iPhone, the most recent version listed as hackable was iOS 9.2, which was released in late 2015. Q: What did we learn about the CIA’s hacking program? A. WikiLeaks published documents that it says describe CIA tools for hacking into devices including mobile phones, computers and smart televisions. Q: How can you hack a TV? A: WikiLeaks said it identified a project known as Weeping Angel where U.S. and British intelligence agencies developed ways to take over Samsung smart TVs equipped with microphones, forcing them to record conversations when the device appeared to be turned off. Experts have long said smart TVs and other Internet-connected devices can be exploited to monitor a target. Q: Are these revelations new? A: While the specific details are new, it is well known in the cyber security community that intelligence agencies are constantly trying to leverage flaws in technology products to conduct espionage. Q: The documents suggest that the CIA can access information in encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. I thought they were safe from even government spying?     A: No system is perfect. The documents describe ways to get information in those apps on Android devices, but only after gaining full control of those phones. Reuters has not found evidence in the documents released by WikiLeaks that the CIA had figured a way to break the encryption in those apps. Q: Are iPhones also vulnerable? A: The documents discuss ways to get into iPhones as well. One appeared to show a list of Apple iOS security flaws purchased by U.S. intelligence agencies so they could gain access to those devices. Q: What should I do if I’m worried? A: Most people do not need to worry about being targeted by intelligence agencies. But everybody should stay on top of software patches so all their computers, mobile phones and other connected devices are running software with the latest security updates. Consumers should balance security concerns with their need to use smart devices. Q: What did we learn about how the CIA may try to make American hacking look like the work of hackers from other countries like Russia?      A: The CIA has a library of attack code taken from multiple sources and sorted by function, including a program from a Russian criminal kit that permits spyware to survive rebooting and a data-destruction tool lifted from a suspected Iranian operation. One purpose of such a collection is to avoid having to write programs from scratch, while another is to confuse anyone who discovers the malware in action.     The documents released so far do not show that the CIA set out to deceive victims into believing they had been hacked by someone else, but it suggests that the agency was capable of doing so if it wanted.  Q: Is this as big as the leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden? A: The Snowden leaks revealed that the NSA was secretly collecting U.S. call metadata on ordinary Americans. The materials released by WikiLeaks on Tuesday did not appear to reveal the existence of unknown any unknown programs. Instead they supplied details on how U.S. intelligence agencies work to discover and exploit security flaws to conduct espionage.  Q: How damaging is this revelation to U.S. intelligence?     A: U.S. intelligence officials say the damage is limited because much of what was published is old, a number of the vulnerabilities in smart TVs and other devices have been known for at least two years and many have been patched. The breach   was discovered late last year according to U.S. officials and most or all of the tools Wikileaks published are no longer in use. In addition, they said, unless additional codes that would enable users to exploit the leaked material are also published, it would be difficult for other countries, groups, or people to use the leaked material against the United States or its allies. Q: Are the documents authentic?     A: Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents. U.S. officials told Reuters that they believe the documents are authentic. While the CIA has declined to comment, independent cyber security experts and former intelligence agency employees who have looked through them say that they appear to be authentic, citing code words used to describe CIA hacking programs. Q: How did WikiLeaks get the information?     A: Unclear. Someone inside the agency may have leaked the information. Or, someone outside may have figured out a way to steal it. U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that contractors were the likely source for the leak. Q: What has the U.S. government and other governments said in response? A: The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump was “extremely concerned” about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. Germany’s chief federal prosecutor’s office said it would review the Wikileaks documents which suggest the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, and would launch a formal investigation if warranted.

", "predictions": "(Reuters) - WikiLeaks, the platform known for unveiling confidential information, published a large batch of documents detailing private discussions within the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency regarding hacking methods employed from 2013 to 2016 to breach security measures on electronic devices for surveillance purposes. U.S. authorities indicated on Wednesday that contractors working for the CIA were likely responsible for the leak. Here are some common queries and responses for individuals using consumer electronics:\n\nQ: How many of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the WikiLeaks documents are still exploitable by hackers or spies?\nA: The documents do not provide a clear answer. While they outline attack strategies, they often lack sufficient details for device and software manufacturers to comprehend how their products were targeted and to address security gaps effectively. Many flaws have been resolved through software updates, but the exact number that still exists remains uncertain. For instance, the most recent hackable version for Apple's iPhone listed was iOS 9.2, released in late 2015.\n\nQ: What insights did we gain about the CIA's hacking operations?\nA: WikiLeaks released documents alleging that the CIA possessed tools for infiltrating various devices such as mobile phones, computers, and smart TVs.\n\nQ: How is it possible to hack a television?\nA: According to WikiLeaks, there was a project called Weeping Angel where U.S. and British intelligence agencies developed methods to take control of Samsung smart TVs with built-in microphones, enabling them to record conversations even when the TV appeared to be powered off. Experts have long warned about the potential exploitation of smart TVs and other internet-connected devices for monitoring purposes.\n\nQ: Are these revelations groundbreaking?\nA: While the specifics are new, the cybersecurity community has been aware that intelligence agencies continually exploit flaws in technology products for espionage.\n\nQ: Do the documents suggest that the CIA can access information in encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, which are thought to be secure against government surveillance?\nA: No system is flawless. The documents describe techniques to obtain information from these apps on Android devices but only after seizing complete control of the phones. There is no evidence in the WikiLeaks documents indicating that the CIA found a way to break the encryption in these apps.\n\nQ: Are iPhones susceptible to hacking as well?\nA: The documents mention methods to breach iPhones too. One document displayed a list of security vulnerabilities in Apple iOS that U.S. intelligence agencies reportedly purchased to access these devices.\n\nQ: What should individuals do if they are concerned?\nA: Most people need not worry about being targeted by intelligence agencies. However, it is crucial for everyone to regularly update their software to ensure all devices are running on the latest security patches. Consumers must strike a balance between security precautions and the necessity of using smart devices.\n\nQ: What have we learned about how the CIA might attempt to attribute American hacking activities to foreign actors like Russia?\nA: The CIA maintains a library of attack codes sourced from various origins, including a program from a Russian criminal kit and a data-destruction tool connected to a suspected Iranian operation. This library serves the purpose of avoiding the need to create new programs from scratch and potentially confusing anyone detecting the malware. While the documents do not explicitly show the CIA attempting to deceive victims about the source of hacks, they suggest the agency possessed the capability to do so if required.\n\nQ: Is this leak comparable in magnitude to the disclosures from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden?\nA: The Snowden leaks unveiled the NSA's secretive collection of U.S. call metadata from ordinary citizens. Conversely, the materials shared by WikiLeaks on this occasion do not seem to reveal unknown programs. Instead, they shed light on how U.S. intelligence agencies exploit security vulnerabilities to conduct espionage.\n\nQ: How detrimental is this disclosure to U.S. intelligence operations?\nA: U.S. intelligence officials believe the impact is limited as much of the information released is outdated, with many vulnerabilities in devices like smart TVs known for at least two years and numerous patches already applied. The breach was discovered towards the end of last year, and most, if not all, of the tools published by WikiLeaks are no longer in use. Furthermore, without additional codes enabling exploitation of the leaked data, it would be challenging for other entities to utilize this information against the United States or its allies.\n\nQ: Are the documents verified as authentic?\nA: Reuters has been unable to independently confirm the contents of the leaked documents. U.S. officials indicated their belief in the authenticity of the documents, while cybersecurity experts and former intelligence agency personnel who reviewed them suggest they are genuine based on the coded language used to describe CIA hacking programs.\n\nQ: How did WikiLeaks obtain this information?\nA: The origin of the leaked data remains unclear. It is possible that someone within the agency leaked the information, or an external party discovered a means to acquire it. U.S. officials, as reported by Reuters, suspect that contractors were responsible for the leak.\n\nQ: What responses have been issued by the U.S. government and other nations?\nA: The White House expressed grave concern over the CIA security breach leading to the WikiLeaks disclosure. Germany's chief federal prosecutor's office announced its intention to scrutinize the documents suggesting the CIA operated a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt and would conduct a formal investigation if warranted."}
{"src_passage": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Hackers probably linked to Iran s government have hit Saudi and Western aerospace and petrochemical firms, marking a rise in Iranian cyber-spying prowess, security firm FireEye (FEYE.O) said on Wednesday, an assessment shared by other U.S. experts. A FireEye report on Wednesday dubbed the hacker group APT33 and offered evidence of its activities since 2013 in seeking to steal aviation and military secrets, while also gearing up for attacks that might cripple entire computer networks. In a separate but related move last week, the U.S. Treasury Department added two Iran-based hacking networks and eight individuals to a U.S. sanctions list, accusing them of taking part in cyber-enabled attacks on the U.S. financial system. Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, elements of which were also added to the U.S. sanctions list, was not immediately available for comment when contacted by phone by Reuters on Wednesday, the end of the country s working week. FireEye identified APT33 after it was called in to investigate cyber attacks on a U.S. aviation organisation, a Saudi business conglomerate with aviation holdings and a South Korean group with interests in oil refining and petrochemicals. FireEye declined to name the companies.  Iranian fingerprints are all over this campaign, and government fingerprints in particular,  John Hultquist, FireEye s director of cyber espionage analysis, told Reuters.  Right now we are seeing a lot of activity that seems to be classic cyber espionage.  APT33 was the first state-backed group from Iran to join a list FireEye has compiled over more than a decade that identifies campaigns by Chinese, Russian and North Korean cyber spies. APT stands for  Advanced Persistent Threat .  Hultquist said APT33 shared some tools with, but appeared to be distinct from, around 15 different hacking groups with Iranian ties that security researchers have identified in recent years, carrying names like  Shamoon ,  RocketKitten  and  Charming Kitten . The Kitten nomenclature reflected the low level of respect for Iran s hacking capabilities in the past, experts have noted. Several cyber experts described rising maturity and professionalism in Iran s cyber-espionage capabilities.   In recent years, Iran has invested heavily in building out their computer network attack and exploit capabilities,  said Frank Cilluffo, director of George Washington University s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security. Cilluffo, a former homeland security advisor to President George W. Bush, estimated last year in testimony before the U.S. Congress that Iran s cyber budget had jumped twelve-fold under President Rouhani, making it a  top five world cyber-power .  They are also integrating cyber operations into their military strategy and doctrine,  he told Reuters on Wednesday. FireEye said attacks against the Saudi and South Korean groups hit as recently as May and used phishing techniques that involved posting fake job vacancies for Saudi oil jobs to lure corporate victims (goo.gl/mc1BLY). Speaking to reporters in Singapore, FireEye Chief Executive Kevin Mandia said Iranian cyber espionage had grown in sophistication since he first spotted Iranians conducting rudimentary attacks on the U.S. State Department in 2008.  They re good. (They ve) got a real capability there,  Mandia said of Iran. In the investigations of attacks on Western companies and governments that FireEye is hired to do, Iran now ranks with China and Russia in terms of frequency, he said. Iran has been scaling up its cyber capacities since the United States and Israel carried out a cyber assault on Iran in 2010, now known as the  Stuxnet  worm, aimed at disabling centrifuges in its nuclear programme, he said. FireEye s evidence linking Iran to the aviation attacks included the use of the Farsi language in malware that mounted attacks and the fact that hackers observed the Islamic Republic s work week - taking Thursdays off, among other evidence.      FireEye found some ties between APT33 and the Nasr Institute - which other experts have connected to the Iranian Cyber Army, an offshoot of the Revolutionary Guards - but it has yet to find any links to a specific government agency, Hultquist said. He said APT33 had built a destructive attack capacity into the malware used to infect Western companies, but there was no evidence so far it had been activated. However, FireEye believes it is only a matter of time before the group graduates from intelligence gathering to causing lasting damage. Adam Meyer, vice president of CrowdStrike, another top U.S. cyber security firm, said there has been a vast uptick in attacks by Iran against Saudi Arabia since last year. Five years ago, Iran was blamed for a virus attack against oil giant Saudi Aramco and Qatari RasGas, which crippled 30,000 computers at the two organisations. But Meyer said, in hindsight, the  Shamoon  attack was a narrow, unsustained operation. Broader-based attacks against Saudi Arabia since 2016 use similar malware, with some changes, demonstrating Iran s ability to mount on-going campaigns, he said.  This second campaign is being carried out in a sustained way in 2016 and 2017 against the Saudi government, related entities and the telecom sector: They are doing it in a way that seeks to destabilise the Saudi regime,  Meyers said.

A FireEye report on Wednesday dubbed the hacker group APT33 and offered evidence of its activities since 2013 in seeking to steal aviation and military secrets, while also gearing up for attacks that might cripple entire computer networks. In a separate but related move last week, the U.S. Treasury Department added two Iran-based hacking networks and eight individuals to a U.S. sanctions list, accusing them of taking part in cyber-enabled attacks on the U.S. financial system. Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, elements of which were also added to the U.S. sanctions list, was not immediately available for comment when contacted by phone by Reuters on Wednesday, the end of the country s working week. FireEye identified APT33 after it was called in to investigate cyber attacks on a U.S. aviation organisation, a Saudi business conglomerate with aviation holdings and a South Korean group with interests in oil refining and petrochemicals. FireEye declined to name the companies.  Iranian fingerprints are all over this campaign, and government fingerprints in particular,  John Hultquist, FireEye s director of cyber espionage analysis, told Reuters.  Right now we are seeing a lot of activity that seems to be classic cyber espionage.  APT33 was the first state-backed group from Iran to join a list FireEye has compiled over more than a decade that identifies campaigns by Chinese, Russian and North Korean cyber spies. APT stands for  Advanced Persistent Threat .  Hultquist said APT33 shared some tools with, but appeared to be distinct from, around 15 different hacking groups with Iranian ties that security researchers have identified in recent years, carrying names like  Shamoon ,  RocketKitten  and  Charming Kitten . The Kitten nomenclature reflected the low level of respect for Iran s hacking capabilities in the past, experts have noted. Several cyber experts described rising maturity and professionalism in Iran s cyber-espionage capabilities.   In recent years, Iran has invested heavily in building out their computer network attack and exploit capabilities,  said Frank Cilluffo, director of George Washington University s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security. Cilluffo, a former homeland security advisor to President George W. Bush, estimated last year in testimony before the U.S. Congress that Iran s cyber budget had jumped twelve-fold under President Rouhani, making it a  top five world cyber-power .  They are also integrating cyber operations into their military strategy and doctrine,  he told Reuters on Wednesday. FireEye said attacks against the Saudi and South Korean groups hit as recently as May and used phishing techniques that involved posting fake job vacancies for Saudi oil jobs to lure corporate victims (goo.gl/mc1BLY). Speaking to reporters in Singapore, FireEye Chief Executive Kevin Mandia said Iranian cyber espionage had grown in sophistication since he first spotted Iranians conducting rudimentary attacks on the U.S. State Department in 2008.  They re good. (They ve) got a real capability there,  Mandia said of Iran. In the investigations of attacks on Western companies and governments that FireEye is hired to do, Iran now ranks with China and Russia in terms of frequency, he said.

", "predictions": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Saudi and Western aerospace and petrochemical companies have been targeted by hackers believed to have ties to the Iranian government, signaling an increase in Iran's cyber espionage capabilities, as stated by security firm FireEye (FEYE.O) on Wednesday. This assessment is supported by other U.S. experts. A recent FireEye report named the hacking group APT33, providing evidence of its activities dating back to 2013 in attempting to steal confidential aviation and military information, while also preparing for potential attacks that could disrupt entire computer networks. Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned two Iran-based hacking networks and eight individuals for engaging in cyber attacks on the U.S. financial system. The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, some of whose members were included in the sanctions list, could not be reached for comment by Reuters at the end of the country's workweek. APT33 was identified by FireEye during investigations into cyber attacks on a U.S. aviation organization, a Saudi conglomerate with aviation holdings, and a South Korean group involved in oil refining and petrochemicals. FireEye refrained from disclosing the names of the companies involved. John Hultquist, FireEye's director of cyber espionage analysis, emphasized the significant Iranian involvement in these activities, particularly by government entities, stating that current cyber activities appear to align with traditional cyber espionage tactics. This marks APT33 as the first Iranian state-backed group included in FireEye's long-standing list of cyber espionage campaigns by Chinese, Russian, and North Korean actors. The APT33 group shares tools with other Iranian-linked hacking groups, such as Shamoon, RocketKitten, and Charming Kitten, but is distinct in its operations. Observers have noted an improvement in Iran's cyber espionage capabilities in recent years, attributing it to increased investments in cyber capabilities and their integration into military strategies. FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia highlighted Iran's growing cyber espionage sophistication since initial encounters in 2008 and emphasized its current prominence in attacks on Western targets, alongside China and Russia. FireEye connected Iran to recent attacks on Saudi and South Korean entities using phishing techniques that enticed victims with fake job postings in the oil sector. The rise in Iranian cyber capabilities has been linked to retaliatory measures following the Stuxnet cyber attack on Iran in 2010, aimed at disrupting its nuclear program. FireEye's investigations revealed a connection between APT33 and the Nasr Institute, possibly affiliated with the Iranian Cyber Army, an offshoot of the Revolutionary Guards, though no specific government agency link has been confirmed. While APT33 has shown potential for destructive attacks, FireEye has not yet observed the activation of such capabilities, but anticipates a shift towards causing lasting damage in the future. CrowdStrike's Adam Meyer noted a notable increase in Iranian cyber attacks on Saudi Arabia since last year, following the Shamoon attack in 2012. These ongoing campaigns have targeted the Saudi government, related entities, and the telecom sector, aiming to destabilize the Saudi regime."}

The route originates at the junction with SR 17 in Leahy and runs eastward towards Grand Coulee, near the Grand Coulee Dam, where it intersects with SR 155. Continuing southeast from Grand Coulee, SR 174 concludes at SR 21 northwest of Wilbur. Before being designated as SR 174 in 1964, it was comprised of county roads and two highways, Secondary State Highway 10B (SSH 10B) and Secondary State Highway 4C (SSH 4C), from 1937 to 1964.

Access to the western endpoint is via SR 17 southbound, while the Leahy spur of SR 174 caters to those traveling on SR 17 northbound. Exiting Leahy, the highway veers northeastward through grasslands dotted sparsely with farms before bending southeast to meet its Crown Point spur near the Grand Coulee Dam. Crossing over into Grant County and reaching Grand Coulee, the highway is dubbed the Bridgeport Highway. Progressing through the Grand Coulee Dam federal reservation, the state's maintenance ceases for a stretch. Navigating through Grand Coulee, SR 174 passes over the Columbia Basin Canal and encounters SR 155, known as Midway Avenue in Grand Coulee. Post-intersection, the route changes to Grand Coulee Avenue and passes by Grand Coulee Middle School and Skilskin High School before exiting the city and county boundaries.

One such secondary highway, Secondary State Highway 10B (SSH 10B), ran from Primary State Highway 10 (PSH 10) in Bridgeport to Coulee Dam, near the Grand Coulee Dam constructed in 1942. Another, SSH 4C, ran from Grand Coulee to PSH 4 near Wilbur. In 1951, the western terminus of SSH 10B shifted from Bridgeport to PSH 10 in Leahy and an extension from PSH 2 in Farmer to PSH 10 in Mansfield. A branch of SSH 10B leading to the Crown Point viewing area of the Grand Coulee Dam was added in 1955. The formation of SR 174 followed a 1964 renumbering of Washington state highways, marking the end of the previous primary and secondary highway system. The consolidation of SSH 10B and SSH 4C culminated in the birth of the new highway, effective in 1970. Subsequently, in 2009, a secondary spur in Leahy was introduced and incorporated into the state highway system."}

Henriette originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 15. After traversing the Atlantic and entering the eastern Pacific on August 29, it developed a low-level circulation that was classified as a tropical depression on September 1. The following day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henriette, and it further strengthened into a hurricane on September 3. The hurricane reached its peak intensity as a Category 2 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, passing over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. On land, wind gusts of 100 mph (160 km/h) were recorded, causing power outages and disruptions to water supplies. Heavy rainfall and a strong storm surge led to widespread flooding that resulted in damage to numerous roads, forcing around 800 individuals to evacuate their homes.\n\n= = Meteorological history = =\n\nA tropical wave departed from the African coast on August 15, moving westward and entering the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. It swiftly developed deep convection and a low-level circulation, culminating in the formation of Tropical Depression Nine-E on September 1, situated approximately 170 miles (270 km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. Initially moving in a west-northwest direction, the depression subsequently veered north-northwest. Benefiting from favorable conditions, the depression gradually intensified into Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2, positioned 220 miles (350 km) west of Manzanillo. By the end of that day, the convection enveloped the circulation center. Rapidly organizing and gaining strength, Henriette advanced to hurricane status on September 3, located 135 miles (235 km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. As it became a hurricane, one computer model projected Henriette to continue its northward track through the Gulf of California, although most forecasts indicated a northwest turn.\nTowards the late hours of September 3, an eye formation initiated within the center of intense convection as Henriette shifted its path to the northwest. The eye became more distinct the subsequent day, with Henriette achieving its maximum intensity of 100 mph (160 km/h) as the northern eyewall section moved over the southern part of the Baja California Peninsula. The hurricane swiftly crossed the southern tip of the peninsula and reemerged into the Pacific Ocean as a weakened cyclone with 85 mph (135 km/h) winds and disrupted convection near the center. The convection gradually diminished as Henriette moved over progressively cooler waters, resulting in its downgrade to a tropical depression on September 6. The storm turned westward and continued to weaken until dissipating on September 8.\n\n= = Preparations and impact = =\n\nOn September 2, shortly after Henriette attained tropical storm status, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for the Baja California Peninsula from La Paz southward. Within a few hours, this was upgraded to a hurricane watch, and 18 hours prior to Henriette's landfall, the watch was escalated to a hurricane warning. Early on September 4, the hurricane warning was extended northward to 25°N. The impending threat of Hurricane Henriette led to a Carnival Cruise Line ship altering its course. Initially planned to visit Mexican ports, the captain redirected the ship to navigate along the southern California coastline. Many passengers, displeased with this change, demanded refunds, prompting the cruise line to offer discounts for future trips and a $40 credit onboard.\nWind speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h) in southern Baja California Sur left a significant portion of Cabo San Lucas without power or water. Overall, around 2,000 individuals were directly impacted by the hurricane. A substantial storm surge caused flooding and extensive damage to roads in the state. Approximately 800 people were evacuated from their residences, with reports of crop losses. Rainfall across the affected areas ranged from about 10 inches (250 mm) on average, with peak measurements exceeding 13 inches (330 mm).

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of Interior, on Tuesday said he would consider an expansion of energy drilling and mining on federal lands but would ensure sensitive areas remain protected. The former Navy SEAL sought to outline a measured approach to the job of managing America’s national parks, forests and tribal lands during a four-hour Senate confirmation hearing that was mostly cordial, lacking some of the hot-tempered grilling that has marked other sessions to vet Trump’s cabinet nominees. “Yes,” he said in response to a question from Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska about whether he would review drilling curbs imposed by President Barack Obama’s administration in her state, home to vast petroleum deposits both onshore and beneath Arctic waters. “I can guarantee you it is better to produce energy domestically under reasonable regulation than overseas with no regulation ... We need an economy.” But he added he was committed to protecting sensitive wildlife habitats and to keeping federal lands under federal control to ensure they are preserved for future generations, so “my granddaughter’s children can look back and say that we did it right.” The Interior Department oversees territories covering a fifth of the United States’ surface from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico, including rich deposits of oil, gas and coal and important pasturelands for ranchers. Zinke, an avid hunter and angler, emerged as a surprise pick to head the department in part because he has embraced federal stewardship of public land, diverging from the Republican Party’s official position to sell off acreage to states. But as a congressman he has also fought for increased energy development, a position that has worried conservationists and which fits neatly with Trump’s campaign vows to bolster the U.S. energy sector by scaling back regulation. Over the last eight years, the Interior Department has sought to limit industry access to federal lands and played a key role in Obama’s agenda to combat climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emitting industries. Under Obama, the department banned new coal mining leases on federal property early in 2016. More recently the agency placed parts of the offshore Arctic and Atlantic off-limits to drilling and declared national monuments that protect large parts of Utah and Nevada from development. Zinke said he believed Trump could “amend” Obama’s moves to declare millions of acres of federal property as national monuments. But he said that any move Trump made to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged. He did not comment directly on whether he would seek to reverse Obama’s federal coal-lease ban but said he believed coal plays an important part in the U.S. energy mix and has previously pushed to end the moratorium. Zinke was the first of three Cabinet heads Trump has chosen to oversee his environment and energy portfolio to face Senate scrutiny this week. All three have opposed Obama’s measures to combat global climate change by targeting carbon dioxide emissions. Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, was to testify on Wednesday, and Trump’s choice for Energy secretary, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, was to testify on Thursday. Zinke told committee members that he believes humans contribute to global climate change – a statement that appeared to clash with Trump’s views. Before running for the White House, Trump called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese to weaken U.S. businesses, a position he has since defended. “I do not think it is a hoax,” Zinke said. But he added that he believed there is still debate over the degree to which humans have an impact, and what should be done about it, adding that regulations could sometimes hurt jobs without helping the environment.  He said, for example, he would support efforts by the U.S. Congress to cancel recent regulation imposed by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management aimed at preventing leaks of methane - another gas scientists blame for climate change - from oil and gas installations. In his opening remarks, Zinke struck a moderate tone, saying that he recognizes that some federal lands require strong protection. He also called himself an “unapologetic admirer of Teddy Roosevelt,” a former Republican president who pioneered public land conservation. Zinke also said he would tackle a multi-billion dollar backlog in maintenance at national parks and promised to ensure greater sovereignty for tribes.", "num_tokens": 1050, "num_sentence": 26, "paraphrase_instruction": "Please paraphrase the following text while ensuring the semantics and style of the original are preserved.", "prompt": "Instruction:\nPlease paraphrase the following text while ensuring the semantics and style of the original are preserved.\n\nPassage:\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of Interior, on Tuesday said he would consider an expansion of energy drilling and mining on federal lands but would ensure sensitive areas remain protected.

All three have opposed Obama’s measures to combat global climate change by targeting carbon dioxide emissions. Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, was to testify on Wednesday, and Trump’s choice for Energy secretary, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, was to testify on Thursday. Zinke told committee members that he believes humans contribute to global climate change – a statement that appeared to clash with Trump’s views. Before running for the White House, Trump called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese to weaken U.S. businesses, a position he has since defended. “I do not think it is a hoax,” Zinke said. But he added that he believed there is still debate over the degree to which humans have an impact, and what should be done about it, adding that regulations could sometimes hurt jobs without helping the environment.  He said, for example, he would support efforts by the U.S. Congress to cancel recent regulation imposed by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management aimed at preventing leaks of methane - another gas scientists blame for climate change - from oil and gas installations. In his opening remarks, Zinke struck a moderate tone, saying that he recognizes that some federal lands require strong protection. He also called himself an “unapologetic admirer of Teddy Roosevelt,” a former Republican president who pioneered public land conservation. Zinke also said he would tackle a multi-billion dollar backlog in maintenance at national parks and promised to ensure greater sovereignty for tribes.", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of the Interior, indicated his willingness to potentially expand energy drilling and mining on federal lands while ensuring the protection of sensitive areas. At a four-hour Senate confirmation hearing, Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, presented a balanced approach to managing the nation's national parks, forests, and tribal lands. Unlike other hearings for Trump's cabinet nominees, this session was mostly amicable with Senator Lisa Murkowski asking if he would review drilling restrictions in Alaska imposed by President Obama's administration. Zinke affirmed the importance of domestic energy production under reasonable regulations over overseas production with no regulations, emphasizing the need for a strong economy. However, he also stressed his commitment to safeguarding wildlife habitats and keeping federal lands under federal control for the benefit of future generations. As head of the Interior Department, which oversees a significant portion of America's landmass and natural resources, Zinke's stance on federal land stewardship contrasts with the Republican Party's position of selling off public land to states. Despite being a proponent of increased energy development, Zinke, an avid outdoorsman, has expressed support for federal conservation efforts. He suggested that President Trump might revisit Obama's actions regarding federal property designation but acknowledged the potential legal challenges. Zinke refrained from directly addressing whether he would reverse Obama's federal coal-lease ban but highlighted coal's importance in the country's energy mix. He also stated his belief that humans contribute to climate change, in contrast to Trump's previous statements calling it a hoax. Zinke acknowledged the ongoing debate surrounding human impact on climate change and regulations' impact on job creation and the environment. His approach balances the need for environmental protection with economic considerations, recognizing the importance of maintaining a delicate equilibrium between the two."}

About 58,600 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar, according to U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, as aid workers there struggle to cope. Myanmar officials blamed the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) for the burning of the homes. The group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week that prompted clashes and a large army counter-offensive.  But Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings by the Myanmar army is aimed at trying to force them out. The treatment of Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution. Former colonial power Britain said on Saturday it hoped Suu Kyi would use her  remarkable qualities  to end the violence.  Aung San Suu Kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age, but the treatment of the Rohingya is, alas, besmirching the reputation of Burma,  foreign minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. The clashes and army crackdown have killed nearly 400 people and more than 11,700  ethnic residents  have been evacuated from the area, the government said, referring to the non-Muslim residents. It marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when a smaller Rohingya attack on security posts prompted a military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses.  A total of 2,625 houses from Kotankauk, Myinlut and Kyikanpyin villages and two wards in Maungtaw were burned down by the ARSA extremist terrorists,  the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government.  But Human Rights Watch, which analysed satellite imagery and accounts from Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, said the Myanmar security forces deliberately set the fires. New satellite imagery shows the total destruction of a Muslim village, and prompts serious concerns that the level of devastation in northern Rakhine state may be far worse than originally thought,  said the group s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson. Near the Naf river separating Myanmar and Bangladesh, new arrivals in Bangladesh carrying their belongings in sacks set up crude tents or tried to squeeze into available shelters or homes of locals.   The existing camps are near full capacity and numbers are swelling fast. In the coming days there needs to be more space,  said UNHCR regional spokeswoman Vivian Tan, adding more refugees were expected.  The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Bangladesh is also growing increasingly hostile to Rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live in the poor South Asian country after fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s. Jalal Ahmed, 60, who arrived in Bangladesh on Friday with a group of about 3,000 after walking from Kyikanpyin for almost a week, said he believed the Rohingya were being pushed out of Myanmar.   The military came with 200 people to the village and started fires...All the houses in my village are already destroyed. If we go back there and the army sees us, they will shoot,  he said.  Reuters could not independently verify these accounts as access for independent journalists to northern Rakhine has been restricted since security forces locked down the area in October. Speaking to soldiers, government staff and Rakhine Buddhists affected by the conflict on Friday, army chief Min Aung Hlaing said there is no  oppression or intimidation  against the Muslim minority and  everything is within the framework of the law .

", "predictions": "COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The government of Myanmar reported that over 2,600 homes have been destroyed in Rohingya-dominated areas in the northwest of the country in the past week, marking one of the deadliest outbreaks of violence involving the Muslim minority in decades. According to the UN refugee agency UNHCR, approximately 58,600 Rohingya individuals have sought refuge in neighboring Bangladesh, with aid workers facing challenges in providing assistance. Myanmar officials have attributed the house burnings to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a group that admitted to carrying out coordinated attacks on security posts, leading to clashes and a significant military response. However, Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh allege that the Myanmar army's actions, including arson and killings, are aimed at forcibly displacing them. The handling of Myanmar's roughly 1.1 million Rohingya population poses a significant dilemma for leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been criticized by Western observers for not advocating for the persecuted Muslim minority. Foreign Minister Boris Johnson of Britain expressed hope that Suu Kyi, renowned for her outstanding qualities, would work towards ending the violence. The recent clashes and military crackdown have resulted in nearly 400 fatalities, with over 11,700 non-Muslim residents evacuated from the affected area. The conflict has intensified since October, triggered by a Rohingya attack on security posts and subsequent alleged human rights violations in the military response. Official sources indicate that a total of 2,625 houses were burned in various villages by the ARSA, designated as a terrorist organization by the government. While Human Rights Watch asserts that the Myanmar security forces intentionally set the fires, new satellite imagery suggests widespread destruction in northern Rakhine state beyond initial estimates. With growing numbers of refugees seeking shelter in Bangladesh and existing camps nearing capacity, there is a pressing need for additional space and resources, as per UNHCR reports. The Rohingya community, denied citizenship in Myanmar and labeled as illegal immigrants, faces escalating hostilities in both countries. Displaced individuals like Jalal Ahmed recount harrowing experiences of fleeing their homes and fearing retaliation from the military if they return. Restrictions on media access to the conflict zone have hindered independent verification of such accounts. The Myanmar military has denied allegations of mistreatment of the Rohingya, claiming all actions are lawful and within established protocols. The humanitarian situation in northern Rakhine, already precarious before the violence erupted, has further deteriorated, affecting food security and child malnutrition rates. Aid programs, including vital food assistance, have been halted due to the unrest. Efforts are underway to address the urgent medical and shelter needs of the growing refugee population, including vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and young children. Tahara Begum, a 22-year-old refugee who gave birth en route to Bangladesh, described her ordeal as the most challenging experience of her life."}

{"src_passage": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders could hand Theresa May an olive branch in deadlocked Brexit negotiations next week by launching their own internal preparations for a transition to a new relationship with Britain. Draft conclusions submitted by summit chair Donald Tusk to the 27 other EU governments made final Brussels  rejection of opening free trade talks now. But they also but gave the beleaguered British prime minister hope that they would do so in December   and that, if she ups her offers on divorce terms, the EU will be ready to start talking almost right away. With nerves fraying and threats flying about walking out without a deal come the March 2019 deadline for departure, the pound took a knock when EU negotiator Michel Barnier said a new round of talks this week had ended in continued deadlock over a British refusal to clarify how much it will pay on leaving. But it rallied on word that, despite tough demands from EU governments on what they want from London, the Union is ready to talk about how to avoid a  hard Brexit  and to ease Britain out with less disruption   probably by agreeing to keep it in the single market for a couple of years, diplomats say. The draft of conclusions which would be issued by leaders of the 27 next Friday, a day after meeting May in a full EU summit, still have to be agreed. Envoys, including from heavyweights Germany and France, objected last week to a suggestion from Barnier that the EU should start working on transition plans. But EU officials noted that Tusk, the European Council president, has sounded out most national leaders in recent days   he briefed May by on his preparations on Thursday. A senior EU official closely involved in the negotiations said Brussels did not expect major changes to the summit text. A diplomat from one big country said only that the text would be discussed by national envoys in Brussels on Friday. The first version, seen by Reuters, confirms what Barnier and others have said this month: that there is not  sufficient progress  on agreeing three key elements of a withdrawal treaty for leaders to agree now to open the trade talks May wants.  But in an effort to defuse accusations in Britain about EU intransigence, the leaders would welcome progress to date on their three key issues: the rights of 3 million EU citizens in Britain; protecting peace in Northern Ireland from the effect of a new border on the island; and Britain s outstanding payments. They would pledge to reassess things at their next summit in mid-December   Barnier on Thursday spoke of making progress in the next two months. And in order not to waste time once they do decide to launch talks on a post-Brexit future, they would ask Barnier and their envoys to start preparing now for a transition   albeit without actually starting talking to Britain about it.  The European Council invites the Council (Article 50) together with the Union negotiator to start internal preparatory discussions,  the draft read. Another EU official said that would avoid weeks of delay in launching a new phase by the new year   which business leaders say is vital if they are to make informed investment decisions in 2018 for the time after Brexit. Without a good idea by early next year of what a transition period will look like, international businesses in Britain would start to  vote with their feet  and move operations to the continent for fear of a  hard Brexit , some have warned. The uncertain grip May, who campaigned last year against Brexit, has over her party and hardliners demanding she resist EU demands and be ready to walk out with no deal, has left Europeans unsure of where negotiations may lead. The gesture to May reflects some willingness to help reinforce her in office. Barnier and his British counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, told reporters there had been some progress this week on citizens  rights and the Irish border question. Davis renewed his call for EU leaders to give a green light to trade talks next week but that has long been a forlorn hope. Barnier made clear that despite new momentum from May s  concessions in a speech at Florence last month, British proposals still failed the  sufficient progress  test, notably on tens of billions of euros the EU says London owes. May said Britain would ensure the other 27 countries did not lose out financially from Brexit in the current EU budget period to 2020 and would honor commitments   but Barnier said London was failing to spell out just what it was ready to pay.  There was no negotiation on this, but we did have technical discussions which were useful,  he said.  We are, therefore, at a deadlock on this question. This is extremely worrying for European taxpayers and those who benefit from EU policies.  Nonetheless, he offered hope:  I am still convinced that, with political will, decisive progress is within reach in the coming two months.

Draft conclusions submitted by summit chair Donald Tusk to the 27 other EU governments made final Brussels  rejection of opening free trade talks now. But they also but gave the beleaguered British prime minister hope that they would do so in December   and that, if she ups her offers on divorce terms, the EU will be ready to start talking almost right away. With nerves fraying and threats flying about walking out without a deal come the March 2019 deadline for departure, the pound took a knock when EU negotiator Michel Barnier said a new round of talks this week had ended in continued deadlock over a British refusal to clarify how much it will pay on leaving. But it rallied on word that, despite tough demands from EU governments on what they want from London, the Union is ready to talk about how to avoid a  hard Brexit  and to ease Britain out with less disruption   probably by agreeing to keep it in the single market for a couple of years, diplomats say. The draft of conclusions which would be issued by leaders of the 27 next Friday, a day after meeting May in a full EU summit, still have to be agreed. Envoys, including from heavyweights Germany and France, objected last week to a suggestion from Barnier that the EU should start working on transition plans. But EU officials noted that Tusk, the European Council president, has sounded out most national leaders in recent days   he briefed May by on his preparations on Thursday. A senior EU official closely involved in the negotiations said Brussels did not expect major changes to the summit text. A diplomat from one big country said only that the text would be discussed by national envoys in Brussels on Friday. The first version, seen by Reuters, confirms what Barnier and others have said this month: that there is not  sufficient progress  on agreeing three key elements of a withdrawal treaty for leaders to agree now to open the trade talks May wants.  But in an effort to defuse accusations in Britain about EU intransigence, the leaders would welcome progress to date on their three key issues: the rights of 3 million EU citizens in Britain; protecting peace in Northern Ireland from the effect of a new border on the island; and Britain s outstanding payments. They would pledge to reassess things at their next summit in mid-December   Barnier on Thursday spoke of making progress in the next two months. And in order not to waste time once they do decide to launch talks on a post-Brexit future, they would ask Barnier and their envoys to start preparing now for a transition   albeit without actually starting talking to Britain about it.  The European Council invites the Council (Article 50) together with the Union negotiator to start internal preparatory discussions,  the draft read. Another EU official said that would avoid weeks of delay in launching a new phase by the new year   which business leaders say is vital if they are to make informed investment decisions in 2018 for the time after Brexit. Without a good idea by early next year of what a transition period will look like, international businesses in Britain would start to  vote with their feet  and move operations to the continent for fear of a  hard Brexit , some have warned. The uncertain grip May, who campaigned last year against Brexit, has over her party and hardliners demanding she resist EU demands and be ready to walk out with no deal, has left Europeans unsure of where negotiations may lead. The gesture to May reflects some willingness to help reinforce her in office. Barnier and his British counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, told reporters there had been some progress this week on citizens  rights and the Irish border question. Davis renewed his call for EU leaders to give a green light to trade talks next week but that has long been a forlorn hope. Barnier made clear that despite new momentum from May s  concessions in a speech at Florence last month, British proposals still failed the  sufficient progress  test, notably on tens of billions of euros the EU says London owes. May said Britain would ensure the other 27 countries did not lose out financially from Brexit in the current EU budget period to 2020 and would honor commitments   but Barnier said London was failing to spell out just what it was ready to pay.  There was no negotiation on this, but we did have technical discussions which were useful,  he said.  We are, therefore, at a deadlock on this question. This is extremely worrying for European taxpayers and those who benefit from EU policies.  Nonetheless, he offered hope:  I am still convinced that, with political will, decisive progress is within reach in the coming two months. With David Davis, we will organize several negotiating meetings between now and the end of the year.  May herself said there had been  good progress  and welcomed Barnier s talk of further progress  over the coming weeks . ", "predictions": "Brussels - European Union leaders may offer Theresa May a sign of goodwill in the ongoing Brexit negotiations by initiating internal preparations for a transition to a new relationship with Britain. While the draft conclusions put forward by summit chair Donald Tusk to the other 27 EU governments maintain the rejection of opening free trade talks presently, they hint at the possibility of doing so in December if the UK improves its divorce terms. Amid tensions and uncertainties, the pound fluctuated following news of continued deadlock over financial commitments and a lack of clarity from the UK on exit payments. However, there are indications that the EU is willing to engage in discussions to avoid a hard Brexit and minimize disruption, potentially by extending single market access for a couple of years.\n\nThe forthcoming conclusions, to be issued by the EU leaders after the upcoming full EU summit meeting with May, still require agreement. Despite initial objections from some countries to starting transition planning, there is a growing consensus on the need to be prepared for a post-Brexit era. Progress on key issues such as the rights of EU citizens in the UK, the Northern Ireland border, and financial obligations is acknowledged, with a promise to reassess the situation in December. A focus is placed on moving discussions forward efficiently to provide clarity for businesses making investment decisions post-Brexit. The uncertainty surrounding May's authority and the divergent views within her party add complexity to the negotiations, making it essential for the EU to extend a helping hand to support her leadership.\n\nWhile there have been minor advancements in discussions on citizens' rights and the Irish border, the call for trade talks next week remains a distant prospect. The lack of clarity on financial obligations remains a significant sticking point, with the EU emphasizing the need for London to specify its commitments. Despite the impasse, there is a glimmer of hope for progress in the near future, with the potential for further negotiations in the coming months. May has acknowledged the positive developments and is encouraged by the prospects for further advancements in the talks."}
{"src_passage": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton’s campaign was worried about the “hard balance” she would need to strike as the presidential candidate prepared to oppose a Pacific trade pact championed by President Barack Obama that she once supported, according to emails published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta with exactly four weeks left in the 2016 presidential campaign before the Nov. 8 election. White House hopefuls have made trade a key theme of their campaigns, with the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a prime target for criticism by both Democrat Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump.  In an Oct. 6, 2015, email the day after the Obama administration finalized the details of the TPP, Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin circulated a new draft of a statement the campaign was preparing about Clinton’s position, according to WikiLeaks. “This is indeed a hard balance to strike,” Schwerin wrote in the email to a handful of top advisers, “since we don’t want to invite mockery for being too enthusiastically opposed to a deal she once championed, or over-claiming how bad it is, since it’s a very close call on the merits.”  The next day, as she campaigned in Iowa, the first state to pick candidates during the nominating contest, the campaign released a statement from Clinton saying the pact did not meet the “very high” bar she had set to earn her support. The Clinton campaign declined to verify the authenticity of the latest batch of Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks. Podesta told reporters on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation notified him it is investigating the “criminal” hack of his emails published by WikiLeaks as part of a broader political hacking probe. The U.S. government last week formally accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails.   Clinton’s October 2015 announcement on the TPP came just a week before the first debate in her primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a vocal opponent of the deal. Key Democratic constituencies, such as progressives and organized labor, have also criticized the pact. Clinton had previously declined to say whether she would support the TPP, a main tenet of Obama’s strategic pivot to Asia that began when she was his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, explaining that she wanted to wait to assess the final negotiated terms. “I accept the position we’re taking but she has generally been more pro-trade than anti,” Clinton strategist Joel Benenson responded to the draft from Schwerin. “While we’re opposing this, don’t we want to say something generally about ensuring American manufacturers can compete around the world?” Clinton’s nascent campaign began meeting with advisers to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren even before Clinton announced her second White House bid, according to the hacked emails. In a January 2015 email sent three months before Clinton officially launched her campaign, Schwerin briefed close aides about a meeting with a longtime policy adviser to Warren, a firebrand leader of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing.  Warren’s team was concerned that Clinton would staff her campaign with economic advisers that were too closely associated with the centrist policies of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, such as those championed by his Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin. The Warren adviser, Dan Geldon, “laid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administration’s choices,” Schwerin wrote. Schwerin said he and Geldon went over a list of recommended hires that Warren had sent to Clinton. Geldon told him they would be “watching carefully” to see how Clinton staffed her campaign, Schwerin wrote. “They seem wary - and pretty convinced that the Rubin folks have the inside track with us whether we realize it yet or not,” Schwerin wrote of Warren’s advisers. Geldon declined to comment on the email. Schwerin also added that Geldon expressed “some flexibility on Glass-Steagall,” a Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky trading activities that was repealed during Bill Clinton’s administration. “Said too big too fail is the bigger issue,” Schwerin wrote. Many Democratic activists believe that reinstating Glass-Steagall would help prevent future financial crises such as the one that rocked the U.S. economy in 2008. Warren has said that there are two ways to break up too-big banks, either based on size alone or by instituting a modern version of Glass-Steagall. She introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to reinstate a version of the law. Clinton weighed supporting a new Glass-Steagall law but eventually rejected that route, announcing a risk-based approach for breaking up banks, according to an email WikiLeaks released on Monday.

{"src_passage": "(Reuters) - Mark Strang spends his days delivering farm equipment, listening to politics on the radio during cross-country drives. But in July, the 63-year-old could have an outsized voice in choosing the Republican nominee for president of the United States.  For the first time in 40 years, Republicans could arrive at their national convention in Cleveland without a nominee. If front-runner Donald Trump fails to lock up the nomination before then, as some pollsters are predicting, Strang will have a chance to make history. Strang, from Illinois, is one of 2,472 delegates to the convention who will ultimately determine the party’s choice for the White House this November. In recent elections, the delegates have simply rubberstamped the presumptive nominee. But this year the convention could become a brutal fight in which every delegate vote will count. Trump currently has 673 delegates after winning a string of nominating contests, but if he wants to avoid a floor fight at the convention he needs the magic number of 1,237. There is some doubt among election number crunchers that he can hit it. And that’s when Strang will step into the spotlight. After filling roles in local Republican politics, Strang was selected by Illinois voters to serve as a delegate for Republican candidate U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas. He likes Cruz for his position on guns and immigration.  But if the convention becomes a fight because no candidate has the needed 1,237 delegates on the first round of voting, most of the delegates would eventually be released. States are still sorting through some rules governing how long delegates are bound to candidates. Strang said if he found himself a free agent, he would be open to switching his vote. (Graphic on how a contested convention works: tmsnrt.rs/1ROtOHw) “I am going to be loyal to Ted Cruz, and I will stick with him until I see if there’s no hope. And if there’s no hope for Ted getting in, as I understand it I can pledge my votes to somebody else, and I would hope Ted would understand,” he said. Interviews with Republican state party officials and some delegates who have already been selected reveal widespread soul-searching in anticipation of a potential fight. Officials and delegates described weighing their personal preference with the need to rally around a candidate going into the general election.  Party faithful are steeling themselves for a battle, not just for the nomination, but also for the party’s core values. Establishment Republicans deeply opposed to Trump’s candidacy say he does not represent social and economic conservative values on healthcare, trade and the role of government in daily life.     Trump has built his campaign on anti-establishment rhetoric and promises to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants, impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and restore the country’s manufacturing base. A contested convention would pose a major test for Trump’s campaign, which thus far has eschewed a traditional grassroots organization. His rivals, Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are already trying to lobby delegates who might be open to changing sides once they are allowed to become free agents in the convention. In every state, the party chair and two national committee members, a man and a woman, are automatically selected to be delegates. But from there, state parties use a wide variety of procedures to pick delegates, most of whom won’t be named until late spring or summer. “These are the base of the party,” said Michigan Republican Party chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel. “The delegates are not the establishment. They are the base. And I think that’s a great misunderstanding.” Often sporting outfits with homemade decorated hats or jackets weighed down with dozens of buttons, delegates who show up every four years include everyone from lawmakers to homemakers, and from those who write million dollar checks to retirees who make phone calls.  Many states use small conventions to pick delegates, many of whom are long-time party activists and elected office holders. Not all of them personally back the candidate they are pledged to support in the first round of convention voting, said Virginia Republican Party chairman John Whitbeck.  “We have two former governors, a former attorney general, state senators, state House of Delegates members, party leaders, big and small and donors,” said Whitbeck.  In other states, such as Illinois, some delegates are elected by primary voters. In Ohio, which gives all its delegates to the statewide primary winner, candidates pick their own slate of convention representatives.  Jim Carns, a state representative from Alabama, where delegates are selected in the primaries, signed up to represent Trump last fall — when many still viewed the rise of the New York real estate mogul as a temporary phenomenon. He sees no circumstance in which he would switch candidates. But he knows there will be efforts to win over delegates by both the Trump camp and their opponents.  Once delegates are allowed to change their votes, some establishment figures have floated the potential to nominate someone who didn’t even run for president — such as House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. But most of the 14 delegates interviewed by Reuters dismissed that as an option.   “I almost think that I would walk away from the Republican Party if they did that,” said Strang, the Illinois delegate. “If we’d wanted Paul Ryan, we would have drafted him. And I don’t dislike Paul Ryan, but he didn’t run.” Ryan has said he is not interested in the presidency.

", "predictions": "(Reuters) - Mark Strang, a 63-year-old who spends his days delivering farm equipment and tuning into political discussions during his long drives across the country, could play a significant role in determining the Republican nominee for the U.S. presidency this year. This upcoming Republican national convention in Cleveland is poised to be unique as, for the first time in four decades, the party might not have a clear nominee upon arrival. If the current front-runner, Donald Trump, fails to secure the required number of delegates before the convention, Strang, among the 2,472 delegates attending, could potentially make a historic decision.\n\nIn recent elections, delegates have typically ratified the presumptive nominee without much contention. However, this year's convention could deviate from that pattern, potentially leading to a fierce competition where every delegate's vote carries weight. Trump currently holds 673 delegates, but he needs 1,237 to avoid a contested convention. Some analysts question if he can reach this threshold, setting the stage for individuals like Strang to step into the limelight.\n\nHaving been selected by Illinois voters to represent Republican candidate Ted Cruz at the convention due to his support for Cruz's stances on gun control and immigration, Strang is prepared to stand by Cruz initially. However, if the convention spirals into a contested scenario where delegates are released from their commitments, Strang is open to reconsidering his vote. Party officials and delegates across various states are grappling with the prospect of a contested convention and the need to balance personal preferences with the unity required for the general election.\n\nThe potential showdown at the convention extends beyond the nomination battle to a clash over the party's fundamental values. Establishment Republicans critical of Trump argue that his platform diverges from traditional conservative principles on healthcare, trade, and government's role in society. While Trump's competitors, Cruz and Kasich, are already seeking to sway delegates who could shift their allegiance once they are free to do so, the unconventional nature of Trump's campaign faces a significant challenge in a contested convention setting.\n\nDelegates, ranging from politicians to ordinary citizens, are chosen through various methods across different states, with their loyalty often extending beyond personal preferences to represent the broader party base. As the convention draws closer, the intense lobbying for delegate support intensifies, with the potential for unexpected outcomes such as nominating individuals who did not run for president, like Speaker Paul Ryan, although this remains a divisive prospect among delegates."}

Thus , it is the proportionality factor that relates the molar mass of a compound to the mass of a sample . Avogadro 's constant , often designated with the symbol NA or L , has the value 6 @.@ 022140857 ( 74 ) Ã 1023 mol â 1 in the International System of Units ( SI ) .\nPrevious definitions of chemical quantity involved Avogadro 's number , a historical term closely related to the Avogadro constant , but defined differently : Avogadro 's number was initially defined by Jean Baptiste Perrin as the number of atoms in one gram @-@ molecule of atomic hydrogen , meaning one gram of hydrogen . This number is also known as Loschmidt constant in German literature . The constant was later redefined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of the isotope carbon @-@ 12 ( 12C ) , and still later generalized to relate amounts of a substance to their molecular weight . For instance , to a first approximation , 1 gram of hydrogen element ( H ) , having the atomic ( mass ) number 1 , has 6 @.@ 022 Ã 1023 hydrogen atoms . Similarly , 12 grams of 12C , with the mass number 12 ( atomic number 6 ) , has the same number of carbon atoms , 6 @.@ 022 Ã 1023 . Avogadro 's number is a dimensionless quantity , and has the same numerical value of the Avogadro constant given in base units . In contrast , the Avogadro constant has the dimension of reciprocal amount of substance .\nRevisions in the base set of SI units necessitated redefinitions of the concepts of chemical quantity . Avogadro 's number , and its definition , was deprecated in favor of the Avogadro constant and its definition . Changes in the SI units are proposed to fix the value of the constant to exactly 6.02214X Ã 1023 when it is expressed in the unit mol â 1 , in which an \" X \" at the end of a number means one or more final digits yet to be agreed upon .\n\n= = History = =\n\nThe Avogadro constant is named after the early 19th @-@ century Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro , who , in 1811 , first proposed that the volume of a gas ( at a given pressure and temperature ) is proportional to the number of atoms or molecules regardless of the nature of the gas . The French physicist Jean Perrin in 1909 proposed naming the constant in honor of Avogadro . Perrin won the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics , largely for his work in determining the Avogadro constant by several different methods .\nThe value of the Avogadro constant was first indicated by Johann Josef Loschmidt , who in 1865 estimated the average diameter of the molecules in air by a method that is equivalent to calculating the number of particles in a given volume of gas . This latter value , the number density <formula> of particles in an ideal gas , is now called the Loschmidt constant in his honor , and is related to the Avogadro constant , NA , by\n<formula>\nwhere p0 is the pressure , R is the gas constant and T0 is the absolute temperature .

It serves as the factor that links the molar mass of a compound to the mass of a given sample. Denoted by the symbols NA or L, this constant holds a value of 6.022140857 (74) × 10^23 mol^−1 in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nIn earlier contexts, the concept of chemical quantity was associated with Avogadro's number, a term closely connected to the Avogadro constant but defined differently over time. Initially, Avogadro's number, defined by Jean Baptiste Perrin, represented the number of atoms in one gram-molecule of atomic hydrogen, equivalent to one gram of hydrogen. This term is also known as the Loschmidt constant in German literature. Subsequently, the definition was refined to signify the number of atoms in 12 grams of the isotope carbon-12 (12C) and then generalized to link substance amounts to their molecular weights. For example, approximately 6.022 × 10^23 hydrogen atoms are found in 1 gram of hydrogen element (H), with an atomic number of 1. Likewise, 12 grams of 12C, with an atomic number of 6, contain the same number of carbon atoms, 6.022 × 10^23. Avogadro's number lacks dimension and shares the numerical value of the Avogadro constant but in base units. Conversely, the Avogadro constant is dimensioned as a reciprocal of the amount of substance.\n\nUpdates in the fundamental set of SI units necessitated redefinitions in the realm of chemical quantities. The concept of Avogadro's number and its definition were replaced with the Avogadro constant and its corresponding definition. Adjustments in the SI system aim to precisely set the value of the constant at 6.02214X × 10^23 when expressed in mol^−1, with \"X\" indicating pending final agreed-upon digits.\n\n= = Historical Context = =\n\nThe Avogadro constant derives its name from Amedeo Avogadro, an Italian scientist of the early 19th century, who in 1811 postulated that the volume of a gas (under specific pressure and temperature conditions) is directly tied to the number of atoms or molecules regardless of gas type. The French physicist Jean Perrin, in 1909, suggested naming this constant in tribute to Avogadro. Perrin's efforts in determining the Avogadro constant through various methods earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926.\n\nThe value of the Avogadro constant was first estimated by Johann Josef Loschmidt in 1865, who calculated the average diameter of air molecules, indirectly determining the particle density in an ideal gas. This value, now termed the Loschmidt constant, is linked to the Avogadro constant, NA, through a specific equation involving pressure, the gas constant, and absolute temperature. The symbolism \"L\" occasionally associated with the Avogadro constant pays homage to Loschmidt, especially in German sources where both constants may be denoted by the same name, differentiated solely by units of measurement.\n\nAccurate determinations of Avogadro's number necessitate measuring a single entity on both atomic and macroscopic scales utilizing a unified unit of measurement. This was made feasible when Robert Millikan, an American physicist, measured the electron charge in 1910. The ratio of electric charge per mole of electrons, known as the Faraday constant since Faraday's electrolysis studies in 1834, enables the calculation of Avogadro's number. Over time, advancements in calculations have refined the values of the Faraday constant and elementary charge with increased precision.\n\nInitially named Avogadro's number (N), Perrin used it to denote the molecules in one gram-molecule of oxygen (equivalent to 32g of oxygen as per historical definitions). The transition to the term Avogadro constant (NA) occurred with the introduction of the mole as a fundamental unit in the SI system in 1971, acknowledging the importance of substance amount as an independent dimension of measurement. This shift highlighted that the Avogadro constant no longer remained a mere number but assumed a specific unit, the reciprocal mole (mol^−1).\n\nWhile the mole remains the prevalent unit for amount of substance, the Avogadro constant can also be articulated in alternative units such as the pound mole (lb-mol) or ounce mole (oz-mol)."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Public sector unions triumphed before the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday when the justices preserved a vital source of cash for organized labor, splitting 4-4 on a conservative challenge that had seemed destined for success until Justice Antonin Scalia’s death last month. The case brought by non-union public school teachers in California had targeted fees that many states force such workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities. A loss in this case would have deprived unions representing teachers, police, transit workers, firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout. The outcome illustrated the impact on the court of the Feb. 13 death of Scalia, the long-serving conservative justice who almost certainly would have cast a decisive vote against the unions. But by virtue of splitting 4-4, the justices affirmed a 2014 lower-court ruling that allowed California to compel non-union workers to pay the fees.  “The death of Justice Scalia has proved a disaster for public sector workers who have their paychecks raided by unions,” said Iain Murray, vice president for strategy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.  The court, evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives, left intact a 1977 legal precedent that allowed such fees, which conservatives have long abhorred. Conservatives for years have tried to curb the influence of public sector unions, which typically back the Democratic Party and liberal causes. “The U.S. Supreme Court today rejected a political ploy to silence public employees like teachers, school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, higher education faculty and other educators to work together to shape their profession,” said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association teachers union. The case reached the high court after a Washington-based conservative group, the Center for Individual Rights, sued on behalf of lead plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs, an elementary school teacher in Anaheim, and nine other teachers. They argued the fees infringed upon the free-speech rights of non-union workers under the U.S. Constitution. During Jan. 11 oral arguments in the case, Scalia was still on the bench, giving the court a majority of five conservatives. The conservative justices during the arguments voiced support for the non-union teachers. It is the second case in which the court has split 4-4 since Scalia died, with more likely in the coming months, perhaps including major cases on abortion, voting rights and contraception insurance coverage. It remains unclear when Scalia will be replaced. Senate Republicans have vowed to block confirmation of President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, centrist appellate judge Merrick Garland. Republicans fear Garland’s confirmation would tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. At issue in the case decided on Tuesday were so-called agency fees equivalent to union dues, currently mandatory for non-union workers under laws in about half the states including California. The decision means the status quo remains, with the unions able to collect fees from non-union workers. California’s non-union teachers pay the union, which has 325,000 members, around $600 annually in mandatory fees for collective bargaining. The non-union teachers’ lawyers said they plan to ask the court to rehear case. “With the death of Justice Scalia, this outcome was not unexpected,” said Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights. The split decision means there is “ongoing doubt about the constitutionality of its forcible collection of millions of dollars in dues,” Pell added. About 5 million public sector employees are subject to union contracts that include mandatory fee provisions, according to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which backed the non-union teachers. Organized labor had expressed worries that a ruling throwing out the fees would give employees less incentive to join public-sector unions because they would get all the benefits of collective bargaining undertaken by unions without having to pay for it. The teachers who filed the lawsuit in 2013 asked the justices to overturn the 1977 Abood v. Detroit Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that allowed laws that permitted public sector unions to collect fees from workers who were not members as long as the money was not spent on political activities. Agency fees are already banned in 25 states that have so-called right-to-work laws. In those states, unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower. Federal employee unions also cannot collect such fees. The ruling comes as a relief to organized labor because unionized civil servants in states without right-to-work laws comprise its main power base. The court last week also split 4-4 split in a loan discrimination case. Last month, Dow Chemical Co opted to settle a class action case pending before the court for $835 million, citing Scalia’s death as a reason.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a significant victory for public sector unions, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a tied 4-4 decision on Tuesday that upheld a crucial source of funding for organized labor. The case, brought by non-union public school teachers in California, had challenged the fees that many states require these workers to pay unions in place of full dues to support collective bargaining and related activities. A defeat in this case would have meant a substantial loss of funding for unions representing teachers, police officers, transit workers, firefighters, and other government employees, as well as a decrease in their political influence. The impact of Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February was evident in the court's decision, with the split vote resulting in the affirmation of a lower court ruling from 2014 that allowed California to mandate the payment of these fees by non-union workers.\n\nThe 4-4 split on the case demonstrated the influence of Scalia's absence, as the long-standing conservative justice would likely have sided against the unions. Despite the deadlock, the decision maintained a legal precedent established in 1977 that permits the collection of such fees, a practice strongly opposed by conservatives. The court's even split between liberal and conservative justices left the existing system intact, with the justices emphasizing the importance of allowing public sector employees, such as teachers and school staff, to collaborate through their unions to improve their profession.\n\nThe case, which involved a challenge by non-union teachers led by Rebecca Friedrichs, argued that the mandatory fees violated the free speech rights of non-union workers as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. With the court evenly divided, and with several more potentially divisive cases on the horizon, the implications of Scalia's vacancy on the court remain uncertain. Despite the ongoing legal uncertainty, the decision to uphold the fees was welcomed by organized labor, which views these mandatory fees as essential for sustaining their representation of public sector workers.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision to maintain the status quo regarding agency fees for non-union workers in the public sector marks a significant outcome in the ongoing debate over the role of unions and funding mechanisms in the labor landscape."}

{"src_passage": "LONDON (Reuters) - Any moves by Donald Trump to ban Muslims from entering the United States or bring back waterboarding to interrogate suspects could have repercussions for some of his sprawling foreign business interests — from his golf course in Scotland to luxury resorts in Indonesia. A review of press releases published on the Trump Organization website shows that 15 of 25 new acquisitions or joint ventures announced over the past five years were overseas. These include the purchase of golf courses in Ireland and Scotland and deals to license his name to developers and manufacturers in Dubai, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Mexico and Panama. The deals underscore the potential conflicts of interest Trump will face after he is sworn in as president on Jan. 20 and his vulnerability to criticism that he is open to foreign influence. Foreign governments could potentially seek to exploit Trump’s business interests to affect his decision making, or to punish him through his pocket book for decisions they object to. Trump’s transition team declined to comment for this story. In the 16 months to May, Trump earned up to $23 million from licensing his name to developers in emerging markets, according to a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. “The licensing deals are the best of all because there’s no risk,” Trump told Reuters in an interview in June. “I have 121 deals right now, going forward, right now, 121, all over the world, in China, in Indonesia,” he added. (Trump's foreign business interests: tmsnrt.rs/2gakiTQ) Trump has said he will hand control of his company to his children.  However, when he met with his Indian business partners last week it prompted a chorus of criticism that the wall between Trump and his company was still too porous. The Trump Organization has said a business structure will be set up that complies with “all applicable rules and regulations.” Trump has yet to commit to setting up a blind trust that would formally sever his ties with his business.  “I’m very confident he’s not breaking any laws,” Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. Trump could face a backlash against his business interests in Middle Eastern and Asian markets if he follows through with his campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States, and continues to be open to restoring waterboarding - a form of interrogation widely viewed as torture - or creating a national registry for Muslims, analysts said. “If the Muslim registry is introduced, he will have serious issues finding Muslim local partners,” said Professor Koen Pauwels, a marketing specialist at Ozyegin University, Istanbul. There would be a “backlash” if Trump substantially tightens visa restrictions on Muslim visitors, Pauwels added. In December 2015, Trump’s anti-Muslim comments cost him business in the Middle East when a major chain of department stores halted sales of his glitzy “Trump Home” line of lamps, mirrors and jewelry boxes in the region. Trump has long identified the Middle East as a major growth market, and his company is working with Dubai-based real estate giant DAMAC Properties to build two golf clubs - including one with a course designed by Tiger Woods - and a gated island community outside the city.  His daughter Ivanka said last year the organization was in talks on deals in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Trump has a licensing deal with a developer for a Trump-branded retail complex in Istanbul. He also has signed deals in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, to put his name on a redeveloped luxury golf resort in Java and a luxury cliff-top hotel and residential development in Bali. And it is not just in the Middle East that Trump could face repercussions for any foreign policy decisions. Trump’s $1.5 billion billion-pound golf and residential project north of Aberdeen in Scotland could also be affected, warned councilor Isobel Davidson, who sits on the panel responsible for approving planning applications for the project. If Trump proceeds with any anti-Muslim proposal, it could make it harder for him to advance his development, she said. “Councilors are not supposed to take the character of the applicant into consideration when we are making a planning decision but sometimes it’s quite hard not to,” she said. Analysts said they saw more potential upside for Trump’s business from his election than downside. Very simply, people would want to be associated with the personal brand of the U.S. president. “It will have a boost because he has become more famous that he was before,” said Professor Chiranjib Sen, Azim Premji University in India’s Bangalore. One test case could be China, which the Trump Organization has identified as a “top priority among high-potential emerging markets,” according to a 2013 press release. On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to label China a currency manipulator and impose import tariffs on Chinese imports.  Suisheng Zhao, a China expert at the University of Denver, said if Trump did impose tariffs and more robustly challenged China’s interests in the South China Sea, Beijing could tell Chinese businesses to abandon any talks or deals with the Trump Organization.

A review of press releases published on the Trump Organization website shows that 15 of 25 new acquisitions or joint ventures announced over the past five years were overseas. These include the purchase of golf courses in Ireland and Scotland and deals to license his name to developers and manufacturers in Dubai, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Mexico and Panama. The deals underscore the potential conflicts of interest Trump will face after he is sworn in as president on Jan. 20 and his vulnerability to criticism that he is open to foreign influence. Foreign governments could potentially seek to exploit Trump’s business interests to affect his decision making, or to punish him through his pocket book for decisions they object to. Trump’s transition team declined to comment for this story. In the 16 months to May, Trump earned up to $23 million from licensing his name to developers in emerging markets, according to a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. “The licensing deals are the best of all because there’s no risk,” Trump told Reuters in an interview in June. “I have 121 deals right now, going forward, right now, 121, all over the world, in China, in Indonesia,” he added. (Trump's foreign business interests: tmsnrt.rs/2gakiTQ) Trump has said he will hand control of his company to his children.  However, when he met with his Indian business partners last week it prompted a chorus of criticism that the wall between Trump and his company was still too porous. The Trump Organization has said a business structure will be set up that complies with “all applicable rules and regulations.” Trump has yet to commit to setting up a blind trust that would formally sever his ties with his business.  “I’m very confident he’s not breaking any laws,” Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. Trump could face a backlash against his business interests in Middle Eastern and Asian markets if he follows through with his campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States, and continues to be open to restoring waterboarding - a form of interrogation widely viewed as torture - or creating a national registry for Muslims, analysts said. “If the Muslim registry is introduced, he will have serious issues finding Muslim local partners,” said Professor Koen Pauwels, a marketing specialist at Ozyegin University, Istanbul. There would be a “backlash” if Trump substantially tightens visa restrictions on Muslim visitors, Pauwels added. In December 2015, Trump’s anti-Muslim comments cost him business in the Middle East when a major chain of department stores halted sales of his glitzy “Trump Home” line of lamps, mirrors and jewelry boxes in the region. Trump has long identified the Middle East as a major growth market, and his company is working with Dubai-based real estate giant DAMAC Properties to build two golf clubs - including one with a course designed by Tiger Woods - and a gated island community outside the city.  His daughter Ivanka said last year the organization was in talks on deals in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Trump has a licensing deal with a developer for a Trump-branded retail complex in Istanbul. He also has signed deals in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, to put his name on a redeveloped luxury golf resort in Java and a luxury cliff-top hotel and residential development in Bali. And it is not just in the Middle East that Trump could face repercussions for any foreign policy decisions. Trump’s $1.5 billion billion-pound golf and residential project north of Aberdeen in Scotland could also be affected, warned councilor Isobel Davidson, who sits on the panel responsible for approving planning applications for the project. If Trump proceeds with any anti-Muslim proposal, it could make it harder for him to advance his development, she said. “Councilors are not supposed to take the character of the applicant into consideration when we are making a planning decision but sometimes it’s quite hard not to,” she said. Analysts said they saw more potential upside for Trump’s business from his election than downside. Very simply, people would want to be associated with the personal brand of the U.S. president. “It will have a boost because he has become more famous that he was before,” said Professor Chiranjib Sen, Azim Premji University in India’s Bangalore. One test case could be China, which the Trump Organization has identified as a “top priority among high-potential emerging markets,” according to a 2013 press release. On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to label China a currency manipulator and impose import tariffs on Chinese imports.  Suisheng Zhao, a China expert at the University of Denver, said if Trump did impose tariffs and more robustly challenged China’s interests in the South China Sea, Beijing could tell Chinese businesses to abandon any talks or deals with the Trump Organization. Trump-branded property could also present a target for bombings or other kinds of attacks, said Professor Peter Neumann, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King’s College London. “From a terrorist’s perspective, it’s a very attractive target,” he said.

", "predictions": "Passage:\nLONDON (Reuters) - Possible actions by Donald Trump such as prohibiting Muslims from entering the United States or reintroducing waterboarding for interrogations might impact his various overseas business ventures, including his golf course in Scotland and luxury resorts in Indonesia. Records from the Trump Organization website reveal that, out of 25 new acquisitions or partnerships announced in the last five years, 15 were international. These involve acquiring golf courses in Ireland and Scotland and agreements to license his name to developers and manufacturers in various countries like Dubai, Indonesia, India, and others. These deals highlight the potential conflicts of interest Trump could face once he assumes office as president on January 20, raising concerns about his susceptibility to foreign influence. Foreign governments may seek to exploit his business interests to sway his decisions or to retaliate against decisions they disagree with by impacting his financial interests. Trump's transition team declined to comment on these matters. According to a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, in the 16 months leading up to May, Trump earned up to $23 million from licensing agreements in emerging markets, stating that these are advantageous as they pose no risks. Despite expressing intentions to hand over control of his company to his children, criticism arose when he recently met with his Indian business partners, suggesting that the separation between Trump and his business remains porous. The Trump Organization claims that they will establish a business structure compliant with all relevant regulations, yet Trump has not committed to establishing a blind trust to completely sever ties with his business operations. Trump's stance on banning Muslims or employing controversial interrogation methods like waterboarding could lead to repercussions for his businesses in Middle Eastern and Asian markets. Academic analysts warn that potential actions, such as a Muslim registry or stricter visa restrictions, could hinder his dealings with Muslim partners and affect his market presence in these regions. Trump's anti-Muslim comments in 2015 led to a loss of business in the Middle East, impacting sales of his products in the region. Beyond the Middle East, Trump's projects in countries like Scotland could also be influenced by his foreign policy decisions. While there are risks involved, there is also potential for Trump's businesses to benefit from his presidency due to increased visibility and association with the U.S. president's personal brand. However, actions such as imposing tariffs on China or challenging Chinese interests may lead to repercussions for Trump's business ventures in the country. The potential for attacks on Trump-branded properties and the impact of his decisions on countries accused of human rights violations also play a role in shaping the future of his foreign business interests."}
{"src_passage": "HAVANA (Reuters) - From the Bay of Pigs invasion to a historic visit by President Barack Obama to Havana, Cubans have known for generations that whenever the United States turns its face to Cuba, Fidel Castro would be staring right back. But the death of “El Comandante” has added to worries among  Cubans that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will slam the door shut on nascent trade and travel ties, undoing two years of detente with the United States under Obama. Many Cubans believe they could do with their late leader’s charisma and way with words to counter Trump’s bombast. “With ‘El Comandante’ gone, I am a little fearful of what could happen because of Trump’s way of thinking and acting,” said Yaneisi Lara, a 36-year-old Havana street vendor and flower seller. “He could set back and block everything that’s been going on, all the things Obama has done. And he did a lot, managing to get the U.S. closer to Cuba,” she said, admitting she would consider moving to the United States herself. Trump has struck a very different tone from Obama, who reached an agreement two years ago with Castro’s younger brother, President Raul Castro, to end half a century of hostilities. Late in his election campaign, Trump sought to reassure  Cuban-American voters in Florida that he was firm in his opposition to the Castros, and pledged that, if elected, he would close down the newly re-opened U.S. embassy in Havana. Earlier on, in the primary contests to pick the Republican presidential nominee, Trump said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine, but that Obama ought to have cut a better deal. Now that Trump has won the presidency, it is hard to know exactly what his approach to Cuba will be. “None of that has been decided,” Trump’s senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “The president-elect will make those decisions once he takes office.” However, Reince Priebus, who will be Trump’s chief of staff when he takes office on Jan. 20, said Trump would call for more political freedoms from the Cuban government, and that if he did not get this he would roll back Obama’s opening. “There isn’t going to be a one-way relationship from the United States to Cuba without some action from the Castro administration,” Priebus said on “Fox News Sunday.” After the death of the 90-year-old Fidel Castro on Friday, Obama called him a “singular figure,” while Trump described him as a “brutal dictator.” Castro began his career as a revolutionary by toppling a U.S.-backed government, repelled a CIA-backed counter-revolutionary invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, and faced off against President John F. Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis a year later. During 49 years in office, he crossed swords with 10 U.S. presidents. And while he took a lower profile after officially retiring in 2008, Castro never stopped warning Cubans that the American government was not to be trusted. Although moving closer to the United States, Raul Castro has not given up much ground to the Obama administration in terms of liberalizing Cuba’s one-party political system. Obama did not succeed in convincing Congress to lift the United States’ tough economic embargo on Cuba, but he personally opposed the sanctions and used executive actions to allow more contact and commerce.  The first U.S. commercial flight to Havana in about half a century is due to arrive on Monday. Trump could easily review such measures. He has included Mauricio Claver-Carone, a leading advocate for maintaining a tough economic embargo, in his transition team. Without giving any specifics, Trump said on Saturday that his administration would “do all it can” once he takes office to help increase freedom and prosperity for Cuban people after the death of Castro. “Trump is the polar opposite of Obama,” said burly Havana taxi driver Pablo Fernandez Martinez, 39, as he hustled for work.  Life in Cuba remains hard for its educated but underemployed people, but engagement with the United States has brought in more dollars. Martinez fears that could dry up in Trump’s administration.      “There will probably be less tourist traffic. That will affect everyone in Cuba, and hit the economy,” said Martinez, who earns $100-$120 a week driving for foreigners. Pedro Machado, 68, is a retired engineer in marine research who now rents out rooms in his airy apartment near Havana’s “Malecon” seafront. Watching television with his wife, Machado worried that Trump’s angry rhetoric could spell trouble. “Trump’s policies are very aggressive. We’ll have to see what he actually does. But it certainly looks like bad news for Latin America and for Cuba in particular,” he said. “My generation benefited from Fidel’s revolution, in terms of education, the poor were helped. Not everything was a bed of roses, but Fidel helped us,” he added “The United States has acted as an empire, and that’s what Trump represents.

However, with Castro's passing, concerns have heightened among Cubans regarding President-elect Donald Trump possibly reversing the progress made in trade and travel relations with the U.S. during the Obama era. Many Cubans feel that Castro's charisma and oratory skills would have been valuable in dealing with Trump's outspoken nature. A Havana street vendor named Yaneisi Lara expressed apprehension about Trump potentially undoing the advancements made under Obama and considered the idea of relocating to the U.S. Trump's stance on Cuba differs significantly from Obama's, with past statements indicating a tough approach towards the Castros. While his exact policy regarding Cuba remains unclear, Trump's advisors have suggested a call for increased political freedoms in Cuba as a condition for continuing diplomatic relations established by Obama. The passing of Fidel Castro has evoked mixed reactions, with Obama acknowledging him as a notable figure while Trump branding him as a ruthless dictator. As the transition to Trump's presidency nears, uncertainty looms over the future of U.S.-Cuba relations, especially concerning economic ties and political freedoms. Local Cubans, like taxi driver Pablo Fernandez Martinez and retired engineer Pedro Machado, express concerns over the potential impact of Trump's policies on tourism, the economy, and the overall well-being of Cubans, fearing a shift towards a more aggressive stance detrimental to Latin America and Cuba. Martinez highlights the economic implications of reduced tourist traffic, while Machado reflects on the legacy of Fidel's revolution and expresses pessimism about Trump's intentions as the new leader of the United States."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Wednesday his country was not involved in an effort to influence the U.S. presidential election even as WikiLeaks released another trove of internal documents from Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Last week, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to “interfere with the U.S. election process.” Clinton’s campaign, which has charged the Kremlin is trying to help Republican Donald Trump win the White House on Nov. 8, took its allegations a step further on Tuesday when John Podesta, chairman of the Democratic nominee’s campaign, accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia. At events in Florida, Trump said he had nothing to do with Putin or Russia. “I promise you, I don’t have any business deals with Russia,” Trump said at a rally in Lakeland. In Moscow, Putin said nothing in the hacking scandal is in Russia’s interests and accused all sides in the U.S. presidential campaign of misusing rhetoric about Russia for their own purposes.  “They started this hysteria, saying this (hacking) is in Russia’s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia’s interests,” Putin told a business forum. Putin said his government would work with whoever won the U.S. election, “if, of course, the new U.S. leader wishes to work with our country.”  WikiLeaks, the organization started by Julian Assange that publishes leaked information on the internet, this week released thousands of emails from Podesta’s email account and has not said how it obtained them. Last week, it posted excerpts from Clinton’s private speeches to banking and financial firms.  The Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the messages.  The leaks, coming as the election campaign reaches the final stretch, have the potential to embarrass the Clinton camp. In recent days, however, Trump’s own campaign has been in deeper trouble over the emergence of a 2005 video in which Trump bragged about groping women. Many Republican elected officials have turned their back on him and Clinton’s lead in national opinion polls has increased. Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday, deepening a fracture in the Republican Party.  Clinton, a former secretary of state, has repeatedly accused Trump of having overly friendly ties with Putin and Russia.  She has noted that Trump’s foreign policies have tended to align with Russian’s interests, whether it has been questioning NATO’s role in defending Eastern Europe, failing to recognize Russia’s intrusion into Ukraine, and supporting Russia’s actions in Syria.  Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for office, has shifted his policies on a wide range of issues, from taxes to the minimum wage to immigration during his White House campaign but his statements on Russia have been consistent. His friendly stance toward Moscow departs from the views of many prominent Republicans.  During a presidential debate on Sunday, Trump publicly disagreed with his own vice presidential choice, Mike Pence, who had called for a more hawkish approach toward Russia.     At that debate, Trump questioned whether Russia was behind the hacks, as the U.S. government has asserted. And on Wednesday, during a rally in Ocala, Florida, Trump echoed those remarks. “Have you ever noticed, anything that goes wrong they blame Russia?” Trump told the crowd. “They always blame Russia and then they says Donald Trump is friends . . . I don’t know Putin, folks. What the hell do I have to do with Putin?” Trump has said that as president he would seek warmer relations with Russia and that it would be in the United States’ best interests to seek Russia’s help to defeat Islamic State.  “Trump is the most pro-Russian presidential candidate ever,” said Max Boot, a senior fellow for national security studies at the Council of Foreign Relations. “Putin no doubt sees a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reorient U.S. foreign policy in his direction by electing Trump.” A Russian ultra-nationalist ally of Putin who is known for his fiery rhetoric said Trump was the only person able to de-escalate dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington, and predicted nuclear war if Clinton were elected.      “Relations between Russia and the United States can’t get any worse. The only way they can get worse is if a war starts,” Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant veteran lawmaker, told Reuters.            Clinton campaign chairman Podesta said on Tuesday the FBI was investigating a “criminal hack” of his emails, and he tied the Trump campaign to the leaks by suggesting that a former Trump adviser, Roger Stone, had advance warning of the hacks.  The Trump campaign has not responded to the allegation about Stone, but Trump has denied any coordination with the Russian government to embarrass Clinton.  He has, however, made clear he supports WikiLeaks’ efforts. “I love WikiLeaks,” he said at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.  The United States has an ongoing criminal investigation into Assange’s publishing of classified material. Clinton has been a fierce critic of Assange, who remains at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he sought refuge in 2012 to avoid possible extradition to Sweden.  Last week, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security said the government was confident the hacks of Democratic political groups and campaign officials originated from high levels of the Russian government. The White House on Tuesday promised a “proportional” response to Russia over the hacks.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told CNN the United States has offered no proof of his government’s involvement, and suggested Moscow was unconcerned about possible reprisals. “If they decided to do something, let them do it,” Lavrov said.

Last week, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to “interfere with the U.S. election process.” Clinton’s campaign, which has charged the Kremlin is trying to help Republican Donald Trump win the White House on Nov. 8, took its allegations a step further on Tuesday when John Podesta, chairman of the Democratic nominee’s campaign, accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia. At events in Florida, Trump said he had nothing to do with Putin or Russia. “I promise you, I don’t have any business deals with Russia,” Trump said at a rally in Lakeland. In Moscow, Putin said nothing in the hacking scandal is in Russia’s interests and accused all sides in the U.S. presidential campaign of misusing rhetoric about Russia for their own purposes.  “They started this hysteria, saying this (hacking) is in Russia’s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia’s interests,” Putin told a business forum. Putin said his government would work with whoever won the U.S. election, “if, of course, the new U.S. leader wishes to work with our country.”  WikiLeaks, the organization started by Julian Assange that publishes leaked information on the internet, this week released thousands of emails from Podesta’s email account and has not said how it obtained them. Last week, it posted excerpts from Clinton’s private speeches to banking and financial firms.  The Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the messages.  The leaks, coming as the election campaign reaches the final stretch, have the potential to embarrass the Clinton camp. In recent days, however, Trump’s own campaign has been in deeper trouble over the emergence of a 2005 video in which Trump bragged about groping women. Many Republican elected officials have turned their back on him and Clinton’s lead in national opinion polls has increased.

Trump denied any connection to Russia and Putin expressed that the hacking scandal does not serve Russia's interests, criticizing all sides in the U.S. election for exploiting rhetoric about Russia. Meanwhile, WikiLeaks published emails from Clinton’s campaign and Podesta, with the authenticity not confirmed by the Clinton team. The leaks could be damaging to the Clinton camp as Trump faced criticism over a 2005 video. The rift in the Republican Party deepened as Trump clashed with Speaker Paul Ryan. Clinton has accused Trump of being too cozy with Putin, contrasting his stance with many Republicans. Trump's consistent friendly approach to Russia differs from Pence's more hawkish view. Trump has refuted U.S. claims of Russia's involvement in the hacks and expressed a desire for better U.S.-Russia relations. The FBI is investigating the email hack, with the Clinton camp implicating Trump's campaign, which denies coordination with Russia. The U.S. government blames Russia for the hacks, promising a response, but Russia denies involvement without evidence and appears unfazed by potential consequences."}
{"src_passage": "NEW YORK/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury counselor Antonio Weiss said on Thursday that without a proper restructuring regime, Puerto Rico will default and litigation will intensify, as he pushed Congress to act with legislation to help the island fix its crisis. Weiss, speaking to the House Natural Resources Committee in a hearing about the island’s fiscal crisis, outlined the scale of the problems the U.S. territory faces. “As the cascading defaults and litigation unfold, there is real risk of another lost decade, this one more damaging than the last,” Weiss said. A legislative solution for Puerto Rico, battling with $70 billion debt, may be edging closer. Legislation to find a fix for the island is expected to be drawn up following two Congressional hearings on Thursday - one in front of the House Natural Resources Committee at which Weiss was the sole witness. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he wants the Republican-led House to develop a response to Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis during the first quarter of 2016, and Republicans plan to bring a bill addressing the crisis to the House floor by the end of March. Puerto Rico wants access to a bankruptcy-like mechanism to reduce debt - a view backed by President Barack Obama’s administration and some Congressional Democrats. But majority Republicans have not supported efforts to extend bankruptcy protection to the island, a strategy which could be detrimental to some creditors, and are keen to put Puerto Rico under strict fiscal oversight.  Weiss, in questioning, said that Treasury’s restructuring proposal was not envisioning the Chapter 9 bankruptcy law U.S. states can access for their public agencies, but legislation “customized to the unique conditions that face Puerto Rico.”  Weiss said his team will have to work to convince island leaders of the need for an oversight board for the island. “I think the legislature doesn’t fully understand what this oversight authority would consist of,” he said.  Puerto Rico, with a 45 percent poverty rate, has been in recession for nearly a decade and is losing population to the mainland. It is suffering from a huge debt buildup and has already defaulted on some borrowings.  “There is fear of the future,” said Weiss. “Puerto Ricans are leaving and are joining us on the mainland where they find access to jobs, a future for their children, better healthcare.”  Weiss said that a failure to protect pension payments would “irreparably harm retirees” and add greater stress to Puerto Rico’s economy.  “We are deeply concerned about the pensions in Puerto Rico,” he said.  The Treasury late last year envisioned giving Puerto Rico’s pensioners stronger legal protection than holders of its constitutionally backed bonds if it went bankrupt, according to a draft of a proposed plan seen by Reuters. A separate hearing before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Financial Services focused on the impact to investors in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said without a broad restructuring framework to include more of the debt than a Chapter 9 framework would envision, the issue would not be solved and “we will be back here again.”  Legislation for Puerto Rico could potentially be written as a stand-alone law, which carries the risk of having little momentum to approve it, or attached to a bill related to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a congressional source previously said.  An FAA authorization bill which authorizes funding for the agency could come up for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as next month.        However, a legislative solution may be hard to achieve given the differing views and acrimonious relationship between Republicans, which control Congress, and Democrats.  Tom McClintock, a Republican of California, said instead of increasing regulation, Puerto Rico needs less red tape, less tax burden and could be turned into a “Hong Kong of the Caribbean.”     However, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho said he appreciated that Weiss was “trying to find a solution.” “We don’t agree on every one of your solutions but I can tell that the administration is acting in good faith in finding a solution to the problem,” Labrador said.

Addressing the House Natural Resources Committee during a hearing on Puerto Rico's fiscal challenges, Weiss underscored the extensive issues confronting the U.S. territory. He warned that without swift intervention, Puerto Rico could spiral into a prolonged period of economic hardship even more severe than the previous decade.\n\nThe looming $70 billion debt crisis in Puerto Rico appears to be inching closer towards a legislative resolution.

Instead, they favor implementing strict fiscal oversight.\n\nWeiss clarified that the Treasury's restructuring proposal does not involve the Chapter 9 bankruptcy law that U.S. states can utilize for their public entities. He emphasized the need for tailored legislation specific to Puerto Rico's circumstances. Convincing the island's leaders about the necessity of an oversight board will be a key challenge, as there seems to be a lack of understanding regarding its role. With Puerto Rico grappling with a 45 percent poverty rate, enduring a long recession, and witnessing a population exodus to the mainland, the urgency for a sustainable solution is evident.\n\nConcerns persist about protecting pensions in Puerto Rico, with Weiss highlighting the potential irreparable harm to retirees if payments are not safeguarded. The Treasury's proposed plan aims to offer stronger legal protection to pensioners compared to bondholders in case of bankruptcy.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will sign legislation that imposes sanctions on Russia, the White House said on Friday, after Moscow ordered the United States to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and said it would seize two U.S. diplomatic properties in retaliation for the bill. The U.S. Senate had voted almost unanimously on Thursday to slap new sanctions on Russia, forcing Trump to choose between a tough position on Moscow and effectively dashing his stated hopes for warmer ties with the country or to veto the bill amid investigations in possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. By signing the bill into law, Trump can not ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. Moscow’s retaliation, announced by the Foreign Ministry on Friday, had echoes of the Cold War. If confirmed that Russia’s move would affect hundreds of staff at the U.S. embassy, it would far outweigh the Obama administration’s expulsion of 35 Russians in December. The legislation was in part a response to conclusions by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and to further punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Late on Friday, the White House issued a statement saying Trump would sign the bill after reviewing the final version. The statement made no reference to Russia’s retaliatory measures. Russia had been threatening retaliation for weeks. Its response suggests it has set aside initial hopes of better ties with Washington under Trump, something the U.S. leader, before he was elected, had said he wanted to achieve.  Relations were already languishing at a post-Cold War low because of the allegations that Russian cyber interference in the election was intended to boost Trump’s chances, something Moscow flatly denies. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.    The Russian Foreign Ministry complained of growing anti-Russian feeling in the United States, accusing “well-known circles” of seeking “open confrontation”. President Vladimir Putin had warned on Thursday that Russia would have to retaliate against what he called boorish U.S. behavior. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Friday that the Senate vote was the last straw. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by telephone that Russia was ready to normalize relations with the United States and to cooperate on major global issues. Lavrov and Tillerson “agreed to maintain contact on a range of bilateral issues”, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The ministry said the United States had until Sept. 1 to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, the number of Russian diplomats left in the United States after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December. It was not immediately clear how many U.S. diplomats and other workers would be forced to leave either the country or their posts, but the Interfax news agency cited an informed source as saying “hundreds” of people would be affected. A diplomatic source told Reuters that it would be for the United States to decide which posts to cut, whether occupied by U.S. or Russian nationals.  An official at the U.S. Embassy, who declined to be named because they were not allowed to speak to the media, said the Embassy employed around 1,100 diplomatic and support staff in Russia, including Russian and U.S. citizens. Russian state television channel Rossiya 24 said over 700 staff would be affected but that was not confirmed by the foreign ministry or the U.S. embassy. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement said the passage of the bill confirmed “the extreme aggression of the United States in international affairs”. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov met outgoing U.S. ambassador John Tefft on Friday to inform him of the counter measures, Russian news agencies reported. The U.S. Embassy said Tefft had expressed his “strong disappointment and protest”. Most U.S. diplomatic staff, including around 300 U.S. citizens, work in the main embassy in Moscow, with others based in consulates in St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was also seizing a Moscow dacha compound used by U.S. diplomats for recreation, from Aug. 1, as well as a U.S. diplomatic warehouse in Moscow.  In December, the outgoing Obama administration seized two Russian diplomatic compounds - one in New York and another in Maryland - at the same time as it expelled Russian diplomats. Trump and Putin met for the first time at a G20 summit in Germany this month in what both sides described as a productive encounter, but Russian officials have become increasingly convinced that Congress and Trump’s political opponents will not allow him to mend ties, even if he wants to. The European Union has also threatened to retaliate against new U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they would harm the bloc’s energy security by targeting projects including a planned new pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to northern Europe.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The White House announced on Friday that President Donald Trump will soon sign a bill imposing sanctions on Russia, following Moscow's directive for the United States to reduce its diplomatic personnel and the seizure of two U.S. diplomatic properties. The U.S. Senate recently passed the bill, placing Trump in a dilemma between taking a firm stance against Russia, thereby compromising his desire for improved relations, or vetoing the bill amid suspicions of collusion between his campaign and Russia. If the bill becomes law, Trump will need congressional approval to lift sanctions on Russia. Moscow's response, unveiled by the Foreign Ministry, evoked Cold War tensions. The scale of Russia's actions, affecting U.S. embassy staff, surpasses the expulsion of 35 Russians by the Obama administration. The bill stems from U.S. intelligence reports of Russian interference in the 2016 election and to penalize Russia for the Crimea annexation in 2014. Trump is expected to sign the bill after review, with no mention of Russia's countermeasures. Despite previous hopes for improved relations, Russia's retaliation signals a departure from initial optimism under Trump, who had expressed interest in closer ties. Tensions were already strained due to allegations of Russian election meddling, a claim denied by Moscow. President Putin criticized U.S. behavior, warning of retaliation, with his spokesman indicating that the Senate vote was a tipping point. Russia expressed readiness to normalize relations and cooperate with the U.S. on global issues. The U.S. must reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia by Sept. 1 to match Russian levels. The exact impact on personnel remains uncertain, with reports suggesting \"hundreds\" may be affected. The bill's passage underscores U.S. hostility in international affairs, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Both sides have expressed disappointment over the deteriorating relations, with the EU also considering retaliatory measures."}
{"src_passage": "SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s governor on Wednesday signed an emergency bill allowing the government to halt payments on its debt, throwing into doubt broader restructuring plans to stave off a financial collapse of the U.S. territory. The measure, which earlier passed Puerto Rico’s legislature, lets Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary and could alter the structure of the Government Development Bank (GDB), the island’s primary fiscal agent.  “This legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs — providing essential services to our people — without fear of retribution,” Garcia Padilla said in a statement. Puerto Rico, burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay, a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, faces economic collapse without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors. Wednesday’s emergency law was rushed into existence as the GDB faces possible default on a $422 million debt payment due on May 1. Garcia Padilla had said he would consider a debt moratorium ahead of that deadline. GDB and its creditors are trying to work out a consensual restructuring. But the new law could spark “a new era of litigation” from creditors, said Daniel Hanson, an analyst with Height Securities. “We believe the overwhelming majority of Puerto Rican issuers have violated their creditors’ rights,” he said in a Wednesday note. Some GDB creditors on Monday sued to prevent a run on the bank, asking a federal court to block depositors from taking out their money while talks continue. The passage of the law drew a quick rebuke from some creditors. Stephen Spencer, a financial adviser to bondholders including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers, said it might violate the terms of a prior restructuring deal at PREPA, the island’s power utility.

The measure, which earlier passed Puerto Rico’s legislature, lets Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary and could alter the structure of the Government Development Bank (GDB), the island’s primary fiscal agent.  “This legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs — providing essential services to our people — without fear of retribution,” Garcia Padilla said in a statement. Puerto Rico, burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay, a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, faces economic collapse without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors. Wednesday’s emergency law was rushed into existence as the GDB faces possible default on a $422 million debt payment due on May 1. Garcia Padilla had said he would consider a debt moratorium ahead of that deadline. GDB and its creditors are trying to work out a consensual restructuring. But the new law could spark “a new era of litigation” from creditors, said Daniel Hanson, an analyst with Height Securities. “We believe the overwhelming majority of Puerto Rican issuers have violated their creditors’ rights,” he said in a Wednesday note. Some GDB creditors on Monday sued to prevent a run on the bank, asking a federal court to block depositors from taking out their money while talks continue. The passage of the law drew a quick rebuke from some creditors. Stephen Spencer, a financial adviser to bondholders including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers, said it might violate the terms of a prior restructuring deal at PREPA, the island’s power utility. That deal, under which creditors agreed to take 15 percent repayment cuts, “should be explicitly preserved, rather than being cast into a state of uncertainty,” Spencer said in a statement. He said the law could “close the door to anyone extending new credit to Puerto Rico, seriously impeding its ability to meet citizens’ needs.” In a statement on Wednesday night, PREPA Executive Director Javier Quintana Mendez said the agreement “remains in place and should not be negatively affected by the new law.”  “We continue working in collaboration with our creditors, focused on the implementation of our recovery plan,” Quintana said.

The legislation, endorsed by Puerto Rico’s legislature, grants Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla the authority to impose a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary, potentially affecting the configuration of the Government Development Bank (GDB), the main financial agent on the island. Garcia Padilla emphasized that this measure equips them with the necessary tools to prioritize essential services for the people without fear of repercussions. With Puerto Rico grappling with a massive debt of $70 billion, a high poverty rate, and declining population, drastic actions are required to avert an economic downfall, either through legal adjustments or reaching agreements with creditors. The urgent law, put in place as the GDB faces potential default on a $422 million debt payment due on May 1, could trigger legal disputes from creditors, cautioned analysts. Despite efforts by GDB and its creditors to negotiate a restructuring deal, concerns were raised regarding potential disruptions due to the new legislation. The clash between Puerto Rico and its creditors is intensifying as significant debt repayments loom ahead in May and July. The situation has escalated tension as both sides grapple with finding a viable solution to the financial crisis."}

It is triggered by the formation of the eyewall and can have a round, angular, oval, or irregular shape. This characteristic is visible in tropical storms or hurricanes and plays a role in assessing the storm's intensity. The location of the center within the CDO and the temperature variation between the cloud tops in the CDO and the cyclone's eye are indicators of the cyclone's strength. Strong tropical storms and minimal hurricanes can pose challenges in precisely identifying the center within the CDO due to the dense cloud cover. However, this issue can be resolved by utilizing microwave satellite imagery.\n\nOnce a cyclone reaches hurricane strength, an eye emerges at the center of the CDO, marking the low-pressure center and the cyclonic wind field. Tropical cyclones with fluctuating intensity exhibit more lightning within the CDO compared to stable storms. Monitoring cloud formations within the CDO through frequent satellite updates is also instrumental in determining the storm's intensity. The most intense winds and heaviest rainfall within a tropical cyclone are typically located under the coldest cloud tops in the CDO.\n\n= = Characteristics = =\n\nThe central dense overcast is a vast region of thunderstorms encircling the center of powerful tropical and subtropical cyclones, vividly visible on satellite imagery due to its cold cloud tops. It originates from the development of an eyewall in a tropical cyclone. The shape of the CDO can vary from round, oval, angular to irregular. The progression of the CDO may begin with a narrow, dense, C-shaped convective band. As the tropical cyclone strengthens, the CDO tends to become rounder, larger, and smoother. Environments with minimal vertical wind shear typically produce round CDO shapes.\n\nThe most forceful winds within tropical cyclones are typically found under the most intense convection in the CDO, visible as the coldest cloud tops on satellite imagery. The region with the coldest cloud tops also aligns with the area of maximum wind intensity and highest rainfall in a tropical cyclone. In stable mature cyclones, the CDO usually lacks lightning activity, whereas weaker cyclones or those undergoing intensity changes might exhibit more lightning.\n\n= = Eye = =\n\nThe eye of a storm is a calm region situated at the center of the CDO in strong tropical cyclones. It is typically circular, with a diameter ranging from 30 to 65 km (20 to 40 miles), and is encompassed by the eyewall comprising towering thunderstorms encircling the storm's center. The lowest barometric pressure in the cyclone occurs within the eye, which can be notably lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the storm. In weaker tropical cyclones, the eye may be less defined and obscured by cirrus cloud cover from the surrounding central dense overcast.\n\n= = Use as a tropical cyclone strength indicator = =\n\nIn the Dvorak satellite strength estimation method for tropical cyclones, different visual patterns indicate the intensity range of a cyclone. The CDO pattern is one such pattern, focusing on the size and shape of the central dense overcast. The intensity scale starts at minimal tropical storm levels and considers factors like the positioning of the center within the CDO. The use of banding features and spiral patterns aids in objectively pinpointing the cyclone's center. Advanced satellite technologies, such as polar-orbiting microwave imagery, play a crucial role in accurately determining the center within the CDO.\n\nTropical cyclones with winds between 65 mph (105 km/h) and 100 mph (160 km/h) might have obscured centers within the CDO on visible and infrared satellite imagery, posing challenges in estimating their intensity. Utilizing rapid scan geostationary satellite imagery, which captures images more frequently, can assist in tracking features within the CDO to estimate the cyclone's wind speeds."}

{"src_passage": "MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s leader pledged to press ahead with his independence bid if Spain moves to suspend the region s autonomy, a regional government source said on Wednesday, hours before a deadline over keeping the euro zone s fourth-largest economy united. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given Catalan president Carles Puigdemont until 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday to renounce a secession bid which has rocked markets and rattled the euro, or face direct rule from Madrid. Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence last week and promptly suspended it to ask for talks with Madrid. The source said he would now lift that suspension if Rajoy exercised so-called Article 155 of the Constitution to take back power.  The president said (at) his party s meeting that he will lift the suspension of the independence declaration if the government executes Article 155,  the source said. That article, which has never been used during Spain s four decades of democracy, allows central government to take over any of its 17 autonomous communities if they break the law, which Madrid says Catalonia has done by holding a referendum on independence and pushing for a break-up. Even though it is not clear what direct rule will look like, the prospect has raised fears that social unrest could add to the turbulence, on the heels of an exodus of hundreds of Catalan firms and cuts to economic growth forecasts.  In the latest grim prediction, Spain s independent budget watchdog warned this week that continued uncertainty could wipe as much as 12 billion euros off potential economic growth next year, cutting forecasts by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points. Catalonia accounts for 20 percent of Spain s GDP. If Rajoy triggers the article on Thursday, it will take between three and five days for the government in the wealthy region to be effectively stripped of its powers.   If autonomy is suspended we will have to move in a hurry,  the source said.  Disappointed that last week s declaration was merely symbolic, pro-independence parties in Puigdemont s ruling coalition are now pushing for a formal vote in the Catalan parliament. Earlier on Wednesday, Rajoy urged Puigdemont to  act sensibly  and scrap the bid or risk direct rule, a move which would need only a vote in Spain s upper house, where Rajoy s People s Party holds an absolute majority. The premier repeated a call for clarity on the matter.  It s not that difficult to reply to the question: Has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not, we can talk here,  Rajoy said in parliament.    A central government source later said Madrid viewed a formal independence declaration as  unacceptable blackmail . Since an Oct. 1 independence referendum which Madrid branded illegal, some 700 companies have moved their head offices from Catalonia, according to Spain s companies registry. Despite a violent crackdown by Spanish police to thwart the vote, Catalan officials say 43 percent of voters still managed to cast ballots in the referendum with 90 percent in favor of breaking away.  Banco Sabadell, Spain s fifth-biggest bank, is considering moving its top management to Madrid. Tourism, a vital part of the Catalan economy centred on its seaside capital Barcelona, has also taken a hit, with activity falling 15 percent so far this month, industry association Exceltur said on Tuesday. The region s tourism industry could make 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) less than usual in the fourth quarter  if the volatility and confrontation get worse in the coming months , Exceltur said in a statement. Authoritative Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia reported that Madrid plans to appoint its own delegates to run regional government departments. Puigdemont would remain nominally in his role but stripped of all powers. Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said last week that it was not clear what measures the government would take if direct rule were imposed, but said the government would work on it.

This comes just before a critical deadline for maintaining the unity of the euro zone's fourth-largest economy. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has set a deadline for Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to retract the independence declaration by Thursday at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) or face direct rule from Madrid. Last week, Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence which he promptly paused to seek dialogue with Madrid. The regional government source indicated that if Rajoy invokes Article 155 of the Constitution to reclaim control, Puigdemont will lift the suspension on the declaration of independence. Article 155, a provision never previously used in Spain's democratic history, permits the central government to take charge if any of its 17 autonomous communities violate the law, as Madrid argues Catalonia has by holding an independence referendum and advocating secession. Despite uncertainties surrounding the implications of direct rule, there are concerns that potential social unrest may escalate, particularly following the departure of numerous Catalan companies and downgrades in economic growth forecasts. Spain's independent budget watchdog cautioned this week that the ongoing uncertainty could reduce potential economic growth by up to 12 billion euros next year, leading to cuts in growth projections of 0.4 to 1.2 percentage points. Catalonia represents 20 percent of Spain's GDP. If Article 155 is activated on Thursday, it would take about three to five days for the government in the prosperous region to be stripped of its powers. The regional source mentioned, \"If autonomy is suspended, quick action will be necessary.\" Disappointed by the symbolic nature of last week's declaration, pro-independence factions within Puigdemont's coalition are pushing for a formal vote in the Catalan parliament. Earlier on Wednesday, Rajoy urged Puigdemont to reconsider his actions and abandon the independence pursuit to avoid direct rule, which could be implemented with a vote in Spain's upper house where Rajoy's party holds a majority. Rajoy stressed the importance of clarity on the situation, stating, \"It's not difficult to answer the question: Has Catalonia declared independence?\" Madrid views a formal independence declaration as \"unacceptable blackmail,\" according to a government source. Since the illegal independence referendum on October 1, around 700 companies have relocated their headquarters from Catalonia. Despite efforts to prevent the vote by Spanish authorities, Catalan officials reported that 43 percent of eligible voters participated in the referendum, with 90 percent in favor of independence. Banco Sabadell, one of Spain's largest banks, is contemplating moving its senior management to Madrid. The tourism sector in Catalonia, especially in the capital Barcelona, has also suffered, with a reported 15 percent decline in activity this month. Industry association Exceltur warned that the region's tourism industry could lose 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) in the fourth quarter if the situation worsens. Reports indicate that Madrid is planning to install its own representatives to manage regional government departments, leaving Puigdemont with a nominal role devoid of power. Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis mentioned that the government is working on a plan in case of direct rule imposition. Despite speculations that Puigdemont may declare independence and call for constituent elections, a Catalan official dismissed the idea, stating, \"Elections are not being considered at this time.\" Tensions rose following the imprisonment of two separatist leaders on allegations of sedition. Protesters gathered in Barcelona, demanding their release and chanting slogans against the authorities."}

Mardjoeki vanishes, leaving behind his son Mochtar (Mohamad Mochtar), who is mistreated and abused by Djoekri and his associate, Hasan. Meanwhile, Djoekri's son Joesoef (Mohamad Sani) lives a life of luxury. The emergence of a masked figure known as the \"Black Wolf\" disrupts Djoekri's operations, thwarting Joesoef's pursuits of Soehaemi (Hadidjah), whom Mochtar loves.

The music, composed in the kroncong style, a popular genre with Portuguese influences, featured performances by Hadidjah and Tan Tjeng Bok.\n\nRelease and Reception:\nPremiering in early 1941, Srigala Item was one of several releases by JIF and its subsidiaries that year, captivating audiences with its sensational and action-packed narrative. The film, promoted as suitable for all age groups, garnered praise in a review by Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, predicting its commercial triumph.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. legislation may be needed to require social media companies to disclose more about how their platforms are used for political advertising, a senior Democratic lawmaker said on Thursday, after new signs of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that an operation likely based in Russia had placed thousands of U.S. ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights on the site during a two-year period through May 2017.  The world’s largest social network was already under fire for how little transparency it provides about digital political ads. Voters, researchers and journalists cannot see many of the ads politicians and interest groups run on Facebook to target certain groups, nor can they discover who paid for them. Senator Mark Warner said Congress may need to update laws in order to make them consistent with rules governing television advertising. “An American can still figure out what the content is being used in TV advertising. You can go look at the ad,” Warner, of Virginia, said at a security conference.  “But in social media there is no such requirement. So, you know, we may need a legislative solution,” he said. A second Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, said on Thursday that he supported regulating social media ads like TV ads.  U.S. intelligence agencies say there was an extensive Russian cyber-influence operation during the 2016 election campaign aimed at helping Donald Trump, a Republican, defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations. Watchdog group Common Cause on Thursday filed a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission alleging that unknown foreign nationals made expenditures during the election in violation of American election law.  Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he believed what Facebook disclosed was “the tip of the iceberg” and that Twitter Inc and other tech companies should also examine the issue. Twitter declined to comment. Google, the search engine which also owns video-sharing website YouTube, said on Thursday it had seen no evidence of an ad campaign like the one Facebook disclosed.  Warner’s committee is among those investigating alleged Russian meddling and whether members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Facebook’s disclosure about Russian advertising created more questions than it answered, such as which candidates the ads supported and how savvy the targeting was, said David Lazer, a Northeastern University political scientist.  “Does it reflect sophistication and coordination, or did they throw $100,000 at this just to try a bunch of stuff?” he said.  U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, although non-citizens may advertise on issues. Other ads fall into a legal gray area.  Television has been the backbone of political advertising for decades, and local U.S. broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of commercials. The ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets. Online advertising offered by Facebook and other platforms such as Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s Google, though, often targets narrow, carefully constructed audiences based on factors such as age, political preference or interests. Facebook is especially valued by advertisers due to its targeting capabilities. Facebook and Google have, so far, declined to make political ads more transparent. They said on Thursday they were both open to reviewing specific congressional proposals.  Facebook also said it was continuing its investigation into possible nefarious activity.  Facebook briefed U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday and turned over information about the ads to Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading his own investigation into alleged Russian interference, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said after the November election that it was a “pretty crazy idea” to think false news stories on the network tilted the election.  Since then, though, the company and other tech firms have taken a series of steps to address deliberately false stories or manipulation of traffic by bots. Facebook in April released a report on “information operations” on the site, including some aimed at influencing the French election this past spring. The report on Wednesday expands on that and, for the first time, shows how paid advertising may have played a role in Russian influence efforts in the United States.   Much of the advertising on Facebook and Google is self-serve and can be easily ordered up through their websites. “You can, from anywhere in the world, advertise to the entire world through the platform,” said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University law professor. “It’s incredibly empowering, but it doesn’t have all the regulatory trappings that a medium like television has.” ", "num_tokens": 1137, "num_sentence": 36, "paraphrase_instruction": "Please paraphrase the following text while ensuring the semantics and style of the original are preserved.", "prompt": "Instruction:\nPlease paraphrase the following text while ensuring the semantics and style of the original are preserved.\n\nPassage:\nWASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. legislation may be needed to require social media companies to disclose more about how their platforms are used for political advertising, a senior Democratic lawmaker said on Thursday, after new signs of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.

Since then, though, the company and other tech firms have taken a series of steps to address deliberately false stories or manipulation of traffic by bots. Facebook in April released a report on “information operations” on the site, including some aimed at influencing the French election this past spring. The report on Wednesday expands on that and, for the first time, shows how paid advertising may have played a role in Russian influence efforts in the United States.   Much of the advertising on Facebook and Google is self-serve and can be easily ordered up through their websites. “You can, from anywhere in the world, advertise to the entire world through the platform,” said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University law professor. “It’s incredibly empowering, but it doesn’t have all the regulatory trappings that a medium like television has.” ", "predictions": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A senior Democratic official suggested on Thursday that the U.S. may require social media companies to provide more information about how they are used for political advertising, following new indications of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Facebook Inc recently revealed that a likely Russia-based group had posted numerous divisive U.S. ads on the platform between 2015 and 2017, covering sensitive topics such as immigration, race, and LGBTQ rights. The lack of transparency concerning digital political ads on Facebook has raised concerns, as the public, researchers, and journalists cannot easily access information about the sponsors of these ads. Senator Mark Warner proposed the need for legislative changes to align regulations for social media ads with those for TV commercials, where viewers can easily identify the content and its source. Another Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich, also supported the idea of regulating social media ads similar to TV ads. Allegations of a significant Russian influence campaign during the 2016 election, aimed at benefiting then-candidate Donald Trump, have been reported by U.S. intelligence agencies, although Russia has consistently denied any involvement. Various investigations, including by Senator Warner's committee, are ongoing to explore potential Russian meddling and connections to the Trump campaign. The disclosure by Facebook regarding Russian ads has sparked further inquiries into the nature and scope of these online campaigns. While Google has not found evidence of similar activities on its platforms, the call for increased transparency in online political advertising is gaining momentum. Facebook and Google have expressed openness to considering specific proposals from Congress to address these concerns, amid growing scrutiny over their role in election processes."}
{"src_passage": "KOBANI, Syria (Reuters) - Almost three years after Kurdish fighters defeated Islamic State in the Syrian town of Kobani, residents still mourn the dead and feel abandoned by their foreign allies as they struggle to rebuild. Islamic State s defeat in predominately Kurdish Kobani in early 2015 helped turn the tide against the ultra-militant group and marked the start of a more open U.S. military relationship with the Kurdish YPG militia.  But much of the town near the border with Turkey was destroyed, leaving it facing a huge reconstruction challenge and in need of help from the allies that had supported the fight to defeat Islamic State, including the United States. Electricity still works only a few hours a day and regularly cuts out. The internet, using a Turkish communications signal, is expensive and unreliable. That, local officials say, is because aid quickly dried up, and the town s problems could soon be replicated across parts of northern Syria as Islamic State cedes ground.  There were never (reconstruction) projects that reflected the scale of destruction,  said Khaled Barkal, a vice president in the local government. Kurdish ties with the West are complicated by local rivalries and alliances, and by Kurdish efforts to assert autonomy in areas captured from Islamic State. Local officials also accuse the West of trying to appease NATO ally Turkey, which sees the YPG as an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish group waging an insurgency against the Turkish government.  Turkey doesn t want life to return here,  Barkal said. Ankara opposes the YPG role in capturing Arab-majority areas such as Raqqa, saying it threatens demographic change. Kurdish self-assertion in Iraq and Syria has also brought charges of mistreatment of Arabs, which officials deny. Western diplomats in the region say support for the YPG in the battle against Islamic State cannot extend to bolstering a Kurdish-led project to cement an autonomous region. Washington opposes plans for autonomy in northern Syria, with the international community seeking a nationwide resolution to Syria s more than six-year-old civil war. The people of Kobani fear more upheaval lies ahead. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wants to win back control of all Syria, and Kurdish-led authorities are seeking to cement regional autonomy through elections, which could increase tensions.

They said:  We ve killed your daughter and we re posting a picture of her head on Facebook ,  Hassan s brother Ednan Hassan said at their home. The image was later posted, showing a grinning militant holding the 19-year-old s severed head. Fighters are buried in a military cemetery on the edge of town where yellow YPG flags flutter above gravestones. Portraits of dead Kurdish fighters dot the walls of the local administration and hang from rows of lamp posts.     The violence did not end completely when the battle for Kobani was won. In June 2015, months after Islamic State was defeated in the town, the group launched a raid that killed nearly 150 people there including 11 members of Hassan s family. Such experiences have militarized society and the small scale of aid leaves people unwilling to rely on outside help.  The international community left us,  Hassan said.

", "predictions": "KOBANI, Syria (Reuters) - Nearly three years following the Kurdish forces' triumph over Islamic State in the Syrian town of Kobani, the residents continue to grieve for the deceased and feel forsaken by their foreign supporters while grappling with the task of reconstruction. The defeat of Islamic State in predominantly Kurdish Kobani in early 2015 played a crucial role in turning the tide against the extremist group and signaled the beginning of a more collaborative relationship between the U.S. military and the Kurdish YPG militia. However, a significant portion of the town situated near the Turkish border lay in ruins, posing a considerable challenge in terms of rebuilding and necessitating aid from the allies who had aided in defeating Islamic State, including the United States. The provision of electricity is limited to a few hours daily, often experiencing disruptions. The internet, reliant on a Turkish communication signal, proves to be costly and unreliable. Local officials attribute this to the swift reduction of aid, cautioning that the issues faced by the town could soon replicate in other parts of northern Syria as Islamic State relinquishes territory.\n\nKhaled Barkal, a vice president in the local government, remarked, \"There were no reconstruction initiatives that matched the scale of devastation.\" The complex ties between the Kurds and the West are further complicated by local rivalries, alliances, and Kurdish endeavors to assert autonomy in regions liberated from Islamic State control. Local authorities also accuse Western nations of attempting to appease Turkey, a NATO ally, which views the YPG as an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish faction engaged in insurgency against the Turkish government. \"Turkey is not interested in seeing life restored here,\" expressed Barkal. Ankara opposes the YPG's involvement in capturing areas predominantly inhabited by Arabs, such as Raqqa, citing concerns about demographic alterations. Allegations of mistreatment of Arabs due to Kurdish self-determination efforts in Iraq and Syria have been refuted by officials. Western diplomats in the region highlight that the support extended to the YPG in combating Islamic State should not be interpreted as endorsing a Kurdish-led initiative aimed at establishing an autonomous region. Washington is against the proposition of autonomy in northern Syria, with the international community seeking a comprehensive resolution to the enduring civil war in Syria, now spanning over six years. The residents of Kobani fear further turmoil on the horizon, as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad endeavors to reclaim authority over the entire nation, while Kurdish-led authorities strive to solidify regional autonomy through electoral processes, potentially escalating tensions. Despite the challenges faced, the people of Kobani remain resolute. \"We will defend ourselves against any adversary until the end,\" Barkal affirmed."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered a message of ethnic harmony on Friday at a Christian evangelical conference as he sought to calm concern about his criticism of a Mexican-American judge. In a departure from his usual freewheeling style, Trump read a carefully scripted speech from a teleprompter as part of a new push by his campaign to tone down the outspoken New Yorker’s harsh rhetoric. Trump’s remarks included a wide-ranging attack on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and he said money aimed at resettling Syrian refugees in the United States should instead be spent on tackling poverty in U.S. cities. Speaking to the annual conference of the conservative Faith & Freedom Coalition, Trump did not mention the controversy over his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel cannot treat him fairly because of his Mexican heritage. But Trump did make a point of saying he would represent all Americans if elected president on Nov. 8. “Freedom of any kind means no one should be judged by their race or their color and the tone of his hue,” Trump said. “Right now, we have a very divided nation. We’re going to bring our nation together.” Paul Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, had criticized Trump for what he called a “textbook definition of a racist comment” for his remarks about the judge. Other Republican leaders warned Trump to change his tone or risk losing their support. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who  led a movement to derail Trump’s nomination, told CNN he would not consider running for the White House. Romney blasted Trump for comments that he said denigrated Mexicans, women and religion. “Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry and trickle-down misogyny - all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America,” he said. Romney said he expects Trump to get the Republican nomination, but said that he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. He left open the possibility of casting a ballot for the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. As Trump sought to rally more Republicans behind him, Clinton met with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to try and shore up support from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Clinton later addressed the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the nonpartisan arm of the women’s health group, and had Trump trained in her sights. “This is a man who has called women pigs, dogs and disgusting animals, it’s kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights,” said Clinton, the first woman to become the presumptive presidential nominee of a major party.   Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points, nearly the same  as a week ago, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.       Trump on Friday criticized Clinton’s willingness to accept thousands of Syrian refugees into the United States and challenged her to “replace her support for increased refugee admission” in favor of a new jobs program for inner cities.     He stopped short of repeating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, a proposal that has drawn heavy fire from Republicans and Democrats. “We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what’s going on with refugees where we don’t know where they’re coming from,” Trump said. “We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans so they can come out of this horrible situation that they’re in.” At the funeral on Friday of boxing champion Muhammad Ali, a convert to Islam, one speaker, a rabbi, inveighed against politicians promoting intolerance of Muslims.  “We will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down Muslims and blaming Muslims for a few people,” said Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine, who said he attended the ceremony in Louisville, Kentucky, as a representative of American Jews. Trump said Clinton’s refusal to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” - favored by Republicans to describe violent Islamist militants - makes her unfit to be president. The real estate mogul’s struggle to unify Republicans behind his insurgent candidacy was apparent at the evangelical Faith & Freedom conference, where several speakers studiously avoided speaking his name. Former campaign rival Carly Fiorina steered clear of Trump, speaking instead of the need to prevent liberal policies taking hold.  U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, said a Republican president is needed, without mentioning Trump. “We don’t want this contest this fall to just be a contest of personalities,” she said. But conference organizer Ralph Reed was adamant in his support for Trump, saying the New Yorker has energized the evangelical vote in a way that past Republican presidential nominees failed to do. “We understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied,” Reed told the crowd.

He stopped short of repeating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, a proposal that has drawn heavy fire from Republicans and Democrats. “We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what’s going on with refugees where we don’t know where they’re coming from,” Trump said. “We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans so they can come out of this horrible situation that they’re in.” At the funeral on Friday of boxing champion Muhammad Ali, a convert to Islam, one speaker, a rabbi, inveighed against politicians promoting intolerance of Muslims.  “We will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down Muslims and blaming Muslims for a few people,” said Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine, who said he attended the ceremony in Louisville, Kentucky, as a representative of American Jews. Trump said Clinton’s refusal to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” - favored by Republicans to describe violent Islamist militants - makes her unfit to be president. The real estate mogul’s struggle to unify Republicans behind his insurgent candidacy was apparent at the evangelical Faith & Freedom conference, where several speakers studiously avoided speaking his name. Former campaign rival Carly Fiorina steered clear of Trump, speaking instead of the need to prevent liberal policies taking hold.  U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, said a Republican president is needed, without mentioning Trump. “We don’t want this contest this fall to just be a contest of personalities,” she said. But conference organizer Ralph Reed was adamant in his support for Trump, saying the New Yorker has energized the evangelical vote in a way that past Republican presidential nominees failed to do. “We understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied,” Reed told the crowd.         ", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential hopeful Donald Trump, representing the U.S. Republican party, conveyed a message of unity among ethnic groups during a Christian evangelical event on Friday, in an effort to address concerns surrounding his previous criticisms of a Mexican-American judge. In a departure from his usual unrestrained manner, Trump delivered a carefully prepared speech using a teleprompter, reflecting a new strategy by his campaign to soften his typically strong language. Trump's speech covered a broad critique of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, proposing that funds designated for settling Syrian refugees in the U.S. be redirected towards addressing poverty in American cities. Speaking at the Faith & Freedom Coalition's annual gathering of conservative followers, Trump did not explicitly address the controversy regarding his comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel's impartiality based on his Mexican heritage. However, he emphasized his commitment to representing all Americans should he win the presidential election on November 8th. \"Equality of any form means that one's race or color should not be a basis for judgment,\" Trump stated. \"Currently, our nation is deeply divided. We aim to unite our country.\" \n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, a prominent U.S. Republican figure, condemned Trump's remarks about the judge as \"textbook racism\", while other Republican leaders cautioned Trump to adjust his approach or risk losing their backing. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012 who has opposed Trump's nomination, criticized Trump for his disparaging comments about Mexicans, women, and religion. Romney expressed concerns about the negative impact such rhetoric could have on American society. Despite his expectation that Trump will secure the Republican nomination, Romney stated he would not support either Trump or Clinton, leaving open the possibility of backing the Libertarian Party candidate, former Governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico. As Trump worked to garner more support within the Republican Party, Clinton met with Senator Elizabeth Warren to solidify her backing from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Addressing the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, a nonpartisan group advocating for women's health, Clinton took aim at Trump's derogatory language towards women, highlighting the importance of respecting fundamental rights. Clinton maintains an 11-point lead over Trump, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nIn his critique of Clinton, Trump questioned her stance on admitting Syrian refugees into the country and challenged her to prioritize a new job creation program for urban areas over refugee admission. Trump refrained from reiterating his previous proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim entry into the U.S., a move that has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. At the funeral of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who converted to Islam, a rabbi criticized politicians who promote intolerance towards Muslims. Rabbi Michael Lerner denounced such actions, stating that blaming Muslims as a whole for the actions of a few is unjust. Trump criticized Clinton for her reluctance to use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" a phrase favored by Republicans to describe militant Islamist groups, arguing that this omission disqualifies her from the presidency. Despite facing resistance from some quarters of the Republican Party, Trump received staunch support from Faith & Freedom conference organizer Ralph Reed, who praised Trump for energizing evangelical voters in a way previous Republican nominees had not achieved. Reed emphasized that perfection should not be the standard by which candidates are judged."}

{"src_passage": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain’s Nigel Farage will be at the Republican convention in Cleveland next week to dole out lessons from his Brexit campaign. So will Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, who sees Donald Trump as an ally in his crusade to prevent an “Islamization” of the West. But some mainstream European conservatives who have traveled to previous Republican gatherings admit in private to being horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency and are boycotting this year’s spectacle, which runs from July 18-21. Many of the center-right politicians making the trip from Europe admit to secretly rooting for Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. They are going not to support Trump, they say, but to witness “the Donald” in the flesh and experience what is shaping up to be one of the rowdiest, most unpredictable Republican conventions in decades. “We will see whether Trump can reinvent himself at the convention,” Guenter Krings, a senior lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives who will make the trip with just one other Bundestag colleague, told Reuters. “One can only hope so, but I have my doubts.” Politicians from around the world are invited every four years to attend the Republican and Democratic conventions as part of a formal visitors program that includes briefings with campaign managers, pollsters and foreign policy experts. They also spend time in the main convention hall. This year, nearly 120 politicians from center-right parties outside the United States are expected, roughly half of them from Europe.  Trump’s candidacy has presented European parties with traditional links to U.S. Republicans with a dilemma. Many view his positions — on issues like immigration, security, trade and the divisive Brexit question — as closer to those of upstart far-right parties whose rise they are struggling to contain. Four years ago, when Mitt Romney was the Republican candidate, the center-right European People’s Party (EPP), the largest grouping in the European Parliament, sent a delegation of eight members to Tampa. This year there will be no EPP delegation because no-one from the group expressed an interest in attending. Despite the wariness, there is a reluctance to criticize the famously thin-skinned Trump too openly, in part out of fear he could win the election in November and punish his foreign critics, as he threatened to do when David Cameron, the recently departed British prime minister, slammed Trump’s proposal for a temporary U.S. ban on Muslims as “divisive, stupid and wrong”. While the conservative mainstream is leery, Europe’s array of nationalist, anti-immigration parties seem fascinated by Trump, even if some are uneasy about embracing the New York real estate businessman, who has vowed to “make America great again”. A spokesman for Britain’s UKIP party in Brussels confirmed that Farage would attend to “give them some lessons” on Brexit. And Wilders told Reuters that he would be in Cleveland and wanted to meet Trump there. “I hope Donald Trump becomes America’s next president,” Wilders said. “Such a victory would be good for Europe. America and Europe are threatened by the same danger of cultural relativism and Islam.” Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, France’s National Front and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) are not planning to send anyone to Cleveland, the parties said. “We are neutral,” Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told Reuters when asked if he supported Trump. “He defends American interests. He is saying some things that need to be said.”Also absent will be Italy’s Northern League, whose leader Matteo Salvini describes himself as an enthusiastic Trump fan but learned earlier this year that the admiration was not necessarily mutual. Salvini traveled to Pennsylvania in April to attend a Trump rally. He was photographed shaking hands with the Republican candidate and his party said Trump had endorsed Salvini to become Italian prime minister. But a month later, Trump denied in an interview ever having met Salvini and said he had no interest in doing so. Eirik Moen of the International Democrat Union, which coordinates trips to the convention by center-right politicians across the world, said that numbers could be dented this year because countries like Britain, Spain and Australia are in the midst of political transitions, making it difficult for some to travel. Still, eight British Conservatives who sit in the European Parliament are expected to be in Cleveland. On the continent, France’s main center-right party, les Republicains, is not sending a delegation. And the contingent from Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) is unusually small. In Germany, political debate is conducted in a sober, reserved manner and personal attacks are rare, even during election campaigns. Hence the mix of shock and horror at the tone of the U.S. race. Trump has dismissed Merkel as “insane” for letting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country.

So will Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, who sees Donald Trump as an ally in his crusade to prevent an “Islamization” of the West. But some mainstream European conservatives who have traveled to previous Republican gatherings admit in private to being horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency and are boycotting this year’s spectacle, which runs from July 18-21. Many of the center-right politicians making the trip from Europe admit to secretly rooting for Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. They are going not to support Trump, they say, but to witness “the Donald” in the flesh and experience what is shaping up to be one of the rowdiest, most unpredictable Republican conventions in decades. “We will see whether Trump can reinvent himself at the convention,” Guenter Krings, a senior lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives who will make the trip with just one other Bundestag colleague, told Reuters. “One can only hope so, but I have my doubts.” Politicians from around the world are invited every four years to attend the Republican and Democratic conventions as part of a formal visitors program that includes briefings with campaign managers, pollsters and foreign policy experts. They also spend time in the main convention hall. This year, nearly 120 politicians from center-right parties outside the United States are expected, roughly half of them from Europe.  Trump’s candidacy has presented European parties with traditional links to U.S. Republicans with a dilemma. Many view his positions — on issues like immigration, security, trade and the divisive Brexit question — as closer to those of upstart far-right parties whose rise they are struggling to contain. Four years ago, when Mitt Romney was the Republican candidate, the center-right European People’s Party (EPP), the largest grouping in the European Parliament, sent a delegation of eight members to Tampa. This year there will be no EPP delegation because no-one from the group expressed an interest in attending. Despite the wariness, there is a reluctance to criticize the famously thin-skinned Trump too openly, in part out of fear he could win the election in November and punish his foreign critics, as he threatened to do when David Cameron, the recently departed British prime minister, slammed Trump’s proposal for a temporary U.S. ban on Muslims as “divisive, stupid and wrong”. While the conservative mainstream is leery, Europe’s array of nationalist, anti-immigration parties seem fascinated by Trump, even if some are uneasy about embracing the New York real estate businessman, who has vowed to “make America great again”. A spokesman for Britain’s UKIP party in Brussels confirmed that Farage would attend to “give them some lessons” on Brexit. And Wilders told Reuters that he would be in Cleveland and wanted to meet Trump there. “I hope Donald Trump becomes America’s next president,” Wilders said. “Such a victory would be good for Europe. America and Europe are threatened by the same danger of cultural relativism and Islam.” Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, France’s National Front and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) are not planning to send anyone to Cleveland, the parties said. “We are neutral,” Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told Reuters when asked if he supported Trump. “He defends American interests. He is saying some things that need to be said.”Also absent will be Italy’s Northern League, whose leader Matteo Salvini describes himself as an enthusiastic Trump fan but learned earlier this year that the admiration was not necessarily mutual. Salvini traveled to Pennsylvania in April to attend a Trump rally. He was photographed shaking hands with the Republican candidate and his party said Trump had endorsed Salvini to become Italian prime minister. But a month later, Trump denied in an interview ever having met Salvini and said he had no interest in doing so. Eirik Moen of the International Democrat Union, which coordinates trips to the convention by center-right politicians across the world, said that numbers could be dented this year because countries like Britain, Spain and Australia are in the midst of political transitions, making it difficult for some to travel. Still, eight British Conservatives who sit in the European Parliament are expected to be in Cleveland. On the continent, France’s main center-right party, les Republicains, is not sending a delegation. And the contingent from Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) is unusually small. In Germany, political debate is conducted in a sober, reserved manner and personal attacks are rare, even during election campaigns. Hence the mix of shock and horror at the tone of the U.S. race. Trump has dismissed Merkel as “insane” for letting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country. And his idea to build a wall along the Mexican border elicits shudders in Berlin, a city that was divided by its own wall for nearly three decades and will celebrate the 27th anniversary of its fall a day after U.S. voters cast their ballots on Nov. 8. “Many of Donald Trump’s positions — for example his stance toward Muslims, toward immigration from Mexico and gun ownership — are simply not compatible with the positions of the conservatives and other parties in Germany,” said Juergen Hardt, a CDU lawmaker who also acts as the government’s coordinator for transatlantic relations.

", "predictions": "Paraphrased Passage:\nNigel Farage from Britain and Geert Wilders from the Dutch Freedom Party are among the attendees at the upcoming Republican convention in Cleveland, where they plan to share insights from their Brexit campaign and express support for Donald Trump's anti-Islamization stance. While some mainstream European conservatives have previously attended Republican conventions, many are now avoiding this year's event due to their concerns about a potential Trump presidency. Despite their reservations, a number of center-right politicians from Europe are traveling to witness the unconventional spectacle and observe Trump firsthand, with some secretly favoring Hillary Clinton as the preferred candidate. The upcoming convention is anticipated to be one of the liveliest and most unpredictable in recent history, prompting curiosity and skepticism among international politicians. Although European parties with ties to the U.S. Republicans are grappling with Trump's controversial views on various issues, including immigration and trade, they are cautious in openly criticizing him, partly due to fears of potential repercussions if he wins the election. While some European nationalist parties are intrigued by Trump's rhetoric, others are hesitant to fully embrace him. Despite the mixed reactions, there is interest in learning from Trump's campaign strategies, as indicated by the presence of figures like Farage and Wilders at the event. The absence of some European parties at the convention reflects the divisions and uncertainties surrounding Trump's candidacy, with differing opinions on his suitability for the presidency."}

A state of emergency has been declared and around 300 additional security forces have been deployed to the mining area of the eastern province after a string of shootings since Aug. 17 that killed one police officer and wounded six.  They want to disrupt Freeport s operations,  said Suryadi Diaz, a spokesman for the Papua police.  (Freeport) is rich but they are poor, so they just want justice,  Diaz said, adding that the militants were a splinter group of the separatist Free Papua Movement (OPM). Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said the company was  deeply concerned  about security and was using armored cars and helicopters to ferry workers to and from the Grasberg mine in the province s Mimika regency. He said attacks had been launched along the road near the town of Tembagapura, about 10 km (6 miles) from the mine, where families of employees - including expatriates - live. He added that so far there had been no impact on production and shipments from Grasberg, the world s second-biggest copper mine. Last year Freeport Indonesia contributed about a quarter of the parent company s global sales of 4.23 billion pounds (1.92 million tonnes) of copper. Arizona-based Freeport, the world s largest publicly listed copper producer, has been grappling with labor problems at Grasberg and a lengthy dispute with the Indonesian government over rights to the mine. The mine has also be dogged by major concerns over security due to a low-level conflict waged by pro-independence rebels in Papua for decades. Between 2009 and 2015, shootings within the mine project area killed 20 people and wounded 59. Papua and neighboring West Papua provinces make up the western half of an island north of Australia, with independent Papua New Guinea to the east. The provinces have been plagued by separatist violence since they were incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. President Joko Widodo has sought to ease tension in the two provinces by stepping up investment, freeing political prisoners and addressing human rights concerns. Police spokesman Diaz said around 1,000 local residents and migrant workers who pan for gold in Mimika were being prevented by the separatists from leaving the five villages. Security forces had entered the occupied area on Thursday, police and military sources told Reuters, but it was not clear if they had been able to evacuate any of the residents.  We are trying to maximize protection for the community ... because people have been raped and some have had goods stolen,  Papua Police chief Boy Rafli Amar told Reuters. The water supply of Tembagapura town had also been contaminated with kerosene, Boy said, but police had not been able to ascertain if it was an act of sabotage by the same group. Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch said police statements on the matter  should not be taken for granted, due to decades of independent journalists  restrictions in Papua.  In a video purported to come from the National Liberation Army (TPN-OPM), part of the OPM group, dated Sept. 29, a guerrilla action coordinator named as Joni Beanal reads out an open letter warning of attacks on Freeport in order  to destroy it .  The main reason for the integration of Papua into Indonesia was a conspiracy by America and Indonesia in the interests of mining exploitation by Freeport MacMoran in Papuan soil,  the coordinator said in the video seen by Reuters. Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the video. Papua police spokesman Diaz dismissed the recording as  old . Freeport spokesman Pratama declined to comment on the matter. Papua Military Commander Major General George Elnadus Supit said the TPN-OPM posed no significant threat and were  just wild thieves who are perhaps being used by a separatist group .

Freeport contributed $20 million toward Indonesian government-provided security protecting workers and infrastructure in 2016, about one-third of its local security budget. The company paid $668 million to the Indonesian government last year in income taxes, royalties and export duties, making it one of the country s single largest taxpayers. The Panguna copper and gold mine in neighboring Papua New Guinea was abandoned in 1989 after a campaign of sabotage by the rebel Bougainville Revolutionary Army.

The region has been put under a state of emergency, with approximately 300 extra security personnel deployed to the mining zone in the eastern province following a series of shootings since August 17, resulting in the death of one police officer and injuries to six others.

{"src_passage": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has approved a three-year budget for its flagship public health program almost 20 percent lower than what the health ministry said was needed, according to sources and previously unreported government documents reviewed by Reuters.  The federal finance ministry in August renewed the National Health Mission with $20 billion of funding between 2017-20, against the health ministry s estimated requirement of $25 billion, the documents showed.  Officials familiar with the plan said the finance ministry reduced planned funding because of other spending priorities and because of state governments  poor track record of spending the health budgets they ve been allotted in the past. The finance and health ministries did not respond to several requests for comment.  The National Health Mission is one of the world s largest health programs and forms the backbone of public services in India. It provides everything from free drugs to immunization services to millions of rural poor. Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government has hiked federal funding for the overall health budget this year as part of a plan to improve care and meet a 2025 goal of raising health expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP from the current 1.15 percent.  The National Health Mission typically accounts for about half of the federal health budget and officials said the lower spending approval would make achieving the government s 2025 target more difficult.  NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES  After focusing on maternal and child health for years, the program had planned to broaden its priorities to tackle the rising threat of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).  Faced with the lower funding, the health ministry has reduced its three-year allocation to tackle NCDs such as cancer and diabetes to $1.4 billion, close to half of the estimated need of $2.4 billion, the documents showed.  The Lancet, a British medical journal, last week said NCDs caused a disease burden in India  like never before . More than 60 percent of deaths in the country during 2016 were due to non-communicable diseases, up from about 38 percent in 1990, according to the publication.  While funding for such diseases up to 2020 will be higher than in recent years, the lower-than-planned approved funding will slow government efforts to tackle these diseases, two government officials said.  The cutbacks in NCDs (spending) are dangerous ... this can potentially stall the NCD screening and management plan,  said Oommen C. Kurian, a health researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation. India this year introduced free NCD screening for patients in 100 districts, with plans to eventually cover the country. Beyond non-communicable diseases, spending on strengthening the health system - such as improving district hospitals and patient transport services - will be an estimated $4.3 billion between 2017-20, a third lower than the ministry s request. Planned funding for immunization will be $2.9 billion versus $3.2 billion requested. The spending breakdown for different schemes will be finalised once the health ministry is allocated funding in India s annual budget.      Modi s government has taken steps to improve public healthcare including a 27 percent budget hike this year to $7 billion, accompanied by cuts to prices of critical medical devices and drugs. Shamika Ravi, a health expert at Brookings India, said Modi s government was also pursuing  fundamental structural reforms  to improve healthcare, such as the ranking of district hospitals and empowering state medical officers.  There is a lot of background work happening,  said Ravi, who is also on Modi s economic advisory council.  However, critics say more needs to be done to address the underfunded and overburdened public health system. Some 900,000 children in India died before turning five in 2016, the highest in the world, The Lancet estimates. In March, health officials faced criticism from other government departments for the National Health Mission s inefficiencies and were asked to rework the renewal proposal for 2017-20 after they drew up spending estimates of $33 billion.  The health ministry revised the cost to nearly $25 billion, but the finance ministry reduced estimates by another $5 billion while approving the plan, the documents showed. The estimates were pared back because Modi s government has other priorities and because the finance ministry wants to control spending as it seeks to balance fiscal deficit targets while boosting growth, several government officials aware of the process said.  It s about political priorities - you have programs on roads, on infrastructure, on ports,  said one of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The government is also concerned states do not have the governance capacity to spend large health budgets efficiently, officials said. A shortage of workers, bureaucratic bungling and slow procurement processes have plagued the states  health systems. More than $1.4 billion in health budgets was unspent by states by 2015-16, India s federal auditor said earlier this year.

Documents scrutinized by Reuters, which were previously undisclosed, reveal that the federal finance ministry has extended $20 billion in funding for the National Health Mission from 2017 to 2020, while the health ministry had sought $25 billion. The funding decrease was attributed to competing spending priorities and concerns over the historical underutilization of health budgets by state governments. This move may hinder the government's target of increasing health expenditure to 2.5% of GDP by 2025. The National Health Mission, a significant health program in India, serves as a pillar for public healthcare services and caters to various healthcare needs of the rural poor populace. Despite an increase in the overall health budget this year, the reduction in funding for the National Health Mission could impede efforts to address non-communicable diseases. The program had planned to shift its focus towards tackling non-communicable diseases like cancer and diabetes, but the allocation has been cut by nearly half of what was deemed necessary. The Lancet highlighted the escalating burden of non-communicable diseases in India, emphasizing the urgency in addressing these health issues. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of reduced funding on critical healthcare services and programs, which could undermine the government's healthcare improvement objectives. Critics argue that additional measures are required to address the deficiencies in the underfunded and overstretched public health system, especially considering the high child mortality rate in the country. Despite ongoing efforts to enhance public healthcare, challenges such as bureaucratic inefficiencies and inadequate governance capacity at the state level persist, resulting in underutilization of allocated health budgets."}

{"src_passage": "(Reuters) - Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe torture can be justified to extract information from suspected terrorists, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, a level of support similar to that seen in countries like Nigeria where militant attacks are common. The poll reflects a U.S. public on edge after the massacre of 14 people in San Bernardino in December and large-scale attacks in Europe in recent months, including a bombing claimed by the militant group Islamic State last week that killed at least 32 people in Belgium.  Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has forcefully injected the issue of whether terrorism suspects should be tortured into the election campaign.  Trump has said he would seek to roll back President Barack Obama’s ban on waterboarding - an interrogation technique that simulates drowning that human rights groups contend is illegal under the Geneva Conventions. Trump has also vowed to “bring back a hell of a lot worse” if elected. Trump’s stance has drawn broad criticism from human rights organizations, world bodies, and political rivals. But the poll findings suggest that many Americans are aligned with Trump on the issue, although the survey did not ask respondents to define what they consider torture.  “The public right now is coping with a host of negative emotions,” said Elizabeth Zechmeister, a Vanderbilt University professor who has studied the link between terrorist threats and public opinion. “Fear, anger, general anxiety: (Trump) gives a certain credibility to these feelings,” she said. The March 22-28 online poll asked respondents if torture can be justified “against suspected terrorists to obtain information about terrorism.” About 25 percent said it is “often” justified while another 38 percent it is “sometimes” justified. Only 15 percent said torture should never be used.  Republicans were more accepting of torture to elicit information than Democrats: 82 percent of Republicans said torture is \"often\" or \"sometimes\" justified, compared with 53 percent of Democrats.

Surveys by other polling agencies in recent years have shown U.S. support for the use of torture at around 50 percent. A 2014 survey by Amnesty International, for example, put American support for torture at about 45 percent, compared with 64 percent in Nigeria, 66 percent in Kenya and 74 percent in India. Nigeria is battling a seven-year-old insurgency that has displaced 2 million people and killed thousands, while al Shabaab militants have launched a series of deadly attacks in Kenya.

Initially documented in 2002, this species is exclusively found at La Grive M site, where it coexists with another Miniopterus fossil species, the smaller and more prevalent Miniopterus fossilis. M. zapfei is identified through five lower jawbones (mandibles) and a single isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). Notably, the fourth lower premolar appears more slender compared to M. fossilis, and the cingulum shelf encompassing the P4 is less pronounced than in present-day Miniopterus.

They acknowledged it as the second described fossil Miniopterus species following Miniopterus fossilis from Slovakia, omitting reference to Miniopterus approximatus from Poland's Pliocene or Miniopterus tao from China's Pleistocene. Another fossil species, Miniopterus rummeli, was identified in Germany's Miocene in 2003. The species name, zapfei, pays tribute to Helmuth Zapfe, the describer of M. fossilis. Miniopterus encompasses around 20 extant species of small insectivorous bats found in southern Eurasia, Africa, and Australia.

Some mandibles retain tooth alveoli for unconserved teeth. Measurements of dental features include p4 dimensions of 1.03 x 0.88 mm, m1 ranging from 1.57 to 1.60 x 1.01 to 1.07 mm, m2 spanning 1.51 to 1.64 x 0.95 to 1.05 mm, a single 1.41 mm long m3, and a solitary P4 measuring 1.38 x 1.52 mm. M. zapfei can be differentiated as a Miniopterus due to possessing three lower premolars (designated p2, p3, and p4), a two-rooted p3, and nyctalodont molars with the posterolophid situated beyond the entoconid cusp. This species is approximately 30% larger than M. fossilis and displays a slimmer p4.

{"src_passage": "CLARK, Philippines (Reuters) - The timing of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  trip to the Philippines this week couldn t have been better, coming just as it celebrated a victory against Islamist militants in Marawi City - with a critical dose of help from the U.S. military. But as Mattis met President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, five Russian warships were parked off the Philippines and Moscow was preparing to formally hand over thousands of assault rifles, a million rounds of ammunition and 20 army trucks at a public ceremony on Wednesday. Duterte, known for his strident anti-American rhetoric, has made no secret of his plans to cultivate ties with America s rivals, Russia and China. Those efforts appear to be starting to bear fruit. Just before he met Mattis, Duterte sat down with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday, who, like Mattis, was attending a gathering of Asian defense ministers north of Manila. Shoigu signed two military deals, including the procurement of unspecified equipment. On Wednesday, Duterte was scheduled to visit a Russian anti-submarine ship, the Admiral Pantaleyev, docked in Manila.  U.S. Ambassador Sung Kim played down any U.S. concerns about Duterte s outreach to China and Russia and noted that the United States, a former colonial power, was the country s only treaty ally, with far deeper ties in the Philippines.  I m not really threatened by this notion that China or Russia are providing some military equipment to the Philippines,  Kim told a small group of reporters traveling with Mattis.   We have been providing very important equipment to the Philippines for many, many years. The fact that the Chinese and the Russians have provided some rifles, I m not sure is really such a cause for concern for the United States.  Duterte s often profanity-laden tirades against the United States have become his trademark during his year-old presidency, and he has chided Washington for treating his country  like a dog,  despite the longstanding U.S. assistance. Still, Duterte s rhetoric has been inconsistent, and he warmly greeted visiting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in August, calling himself a  humble friend  of the United States at the time.  On Tuesday, he cautiously kept to scripted dialogue at the start of his meeting with Mattis, as he welcomed him to the Philippines and spoke warmly of ties.  I want to be (as) politically correct as possible and I want to be understood. So reading this speech will be good,  he said before reporters were escorted out of the room. Ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the Philippines, the U.S. envoy cited an improvement in  tone and substance  in bilateral ties over the 10 months since he s been in his post.  President Duterte has made clear that even as he pursues improved relations with countries like China and Russia, he will continue to focus on making sure that the U.S.-Philippines alliance remains strong,  Kim said. The same day that Mattis landed in the Philippines, Manila announced the end of five months of military operations in a southern city of Marawi held by pro-Islamic State rebels, after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years. The rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have gained influence among local Muslims and have ambitions to use the island of Mindanao as a base for operations in Southeast Asia. Mattis, on his flight to the Philippines, commended Manila on the operation and on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen U.S.-Philippines military ties in talks with the Philippine defense minister.  It was a tough fight,  Mattis said during his flight, adding he thought the Philippines had sent  a very necessary message to the terrorists.  Kim said the U.S. military assistance made a  huge difference  in the battle in Marawi, particularly its intelligence support, including with the deployment of Gray Eagle and P-3 Orion aircraft.  I think all of us were surprised by the extent of infiltration by the terrorists into Marawi City,  he said.  When you encounter a situation like that, you obviously need good intelligence to be able to target key areas and I think that s where our support was quite critical.  On Monday night, Philippine military chief General Eduardo Ano said the U.S. technical support  tilted the balance  because  we had a very hard grasp of the situation in the early days  until information flowed and helped defeat the militants. The United States also provided information Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gave $1.5 million in January for the attack on Marawi, Ano said. But even on Marawi, Duterte has also credited U.S. rival China for its assistance. Duterte said it was one of the 100 sniper rifles donated by China that fired the bullet that killed Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s  emir  in Southeast Asia, on Oct. 16. The ranger unit conducting the operation said the shot was fired from a heavier weapon mounted on an armored vehicle.  Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters on Tuesday about the receipt of heavy equipment from China to help rebuild Marawi, and also noted the receipt of rifles and ammunition from Beijing. He expected to receive four fast boats from China before the end of the year. The United States has for decades been the Philippines  defense treaty ally and its biggest source of hardware and training, providing about $1 billion in equipment since 2000.

However, during Mattis' meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte, five Russian warships were stationed near the Philippines, and Moscow was ready to hand over assault rifles, ammunition, and army trucks. Despite Duterte's anti-American sentiments, he has openly expressed his intention to strengthen relations with Russia and China, which is beginning to show results. Just before meeting Mattis, Duterte held discussions with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who, like Mattis, was attending a conference with Asian defense ministers near Manila. Shoigu signed two military agreements, including equipment procurement. Duterte was set to visit a Russian anti-submarine ship in Manila. U.S. Ambassador Sung Kim downplayed concerns about Duterte's engagement with China and Russia, highlighting the long-standing alliance between the U.S. and the Philippines. Duterte's critical remarks about the U.S. contrast with his more welcoming attitude towards visiting U.S. officials. Despite occasional verbal outbursts, Duterte has stressed the importance of a strong U.S.-Philippines alliance. Mattis commended the Philippines' efforts in Marawi and discussed enhancing military cooperation during his visit. U.S. support, particularly intelligence assistance, played a vital role in the battle against Islamist militants in Marawi. The U.S. has been a key ally of the Philippines, providing significant military aid over the years."}

The meeting at Trump Tower in New York involving Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign advisers is a focus of probes by Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller on whether campaign officials colluded with Russia when it sought to interfere in the U.S. election, the sources said. Russia denies allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and President Donald Trump denies any collusion. The Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees recently questioned behind closed doors Irakly Kaveladze, a U.S. citizen born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the sources said. He is a U.S.-based representative of Azerbaijani oligarch Aras Agalarov’s real estate firm, the Crocus Group. The panels knew Kaveladze was at the June 9, 2016 meeting but became more interested in him after learning he also attended a private dinner in Las Vegas in 2013 with Trump and Agalarov as they celebrated an agreement to hold that year’s Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, the sources said.  Committee members now want to know more about the extent of Kaveladze’s contacts with the Trump family and whether he had a bigger role than previously believed in setting up the Trump Tower meeting when Trump was a Republican candidate for president. The White House declined to comment. Mueller’s office also declined to comment. Scott Balber, a New York lawyer who represents Kaveladze, confirmed that his client attended both the dinner in Las Vegas and the Trump Tower meeting but said he did not set up the second meeting. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, other Trump campaign aides, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya were also at that meeting. Lawyer Balber also said the committees were only seeking Kaveladze’s input as a witness and were not targeting him for investigation. “No-one has ever told me that they have any interest in him other than as a witness,” Balber said.

Islamic State militants have lost swathes of land to various offensives across Syria and Iraq, forced into a diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley. Their defeat in Raqqa would be a milestone in the fight to roll back the theocratic  caliphate  Islamic State declared in 2014 in both countries. Following are some facts about Raqqa: Raqqa sits on the Euphrates river around 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in north central Syria.  Hardline Sunni militant group Islamic State overran Raqqa in January 2014, seizing control from rebel factions opposed to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States has said Islamic State planned and sent teams from Raqqa to carry out attacks on cities including Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.  THE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.  The United States-led coalition supports the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.  The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians. The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.  Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.  Civilians trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city have endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. Parts of Raqqa that the SDF captured have mostly been cleared of residents.     Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.   The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.  Islamic State has imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule. The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.   The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border. The SDF s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF says it will hand control to once its fighters have defeated Islamic State. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured. The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.  Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border.

", "predictions": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The fight for control of Raqqa, once the capital of the Islamic State in Syria, is reaching its conclusion. The Islamic State group has experienced significant territorial losses in both Syria and Iraq, finding itself confined to a shrinking area along the Euphrates river valley. The potential defeat of the Islamic State in Raqqa represents a significant step in dismantling the theocratic caliphate it established in 2014 across both countries. Here are some key details about Raqqa: Situated approximately 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in central northern Syria, Raqqa was overtaken by the extremist Sunni group Islamic State in January 2014, seizing power from rebel factions opposing the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. has indicated that Islamic State used Raqqa as a base to orchestrate attacks in cities like Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul. \n\nTHE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition mainly composed of Kurdish and Arab militias, commenced their advance towards Raqqa in November 2016. Following the encirclement of the city, they initiated an offensive to capture it, facing fierce resistance. The SDF receives air support and on-ground assistance from the U.S.-led coalition. The battle for Raqqa has had a devastating impact on civilians, with reports from the United Nations in March estimating the city’s population to be around 200,000, almost equal to pre-war figures. The conflict in and around Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people, with many seeking refuge in camps controlled by the SDF and its primary component, the Kurdish YPG militia. Civilians trapped within the Islamic State-controlled areas in the city have endured dire conditions, lacking basic necessities like water, electricity, food, and medical aid. The captured sections of Raqqa have been largely evacuated of residents, as air strikes, combat, and actions by Islamic State have resulted in numerous casualties. While the coalition emphasizes its efforts to minimize civilian harm during airstrikes, concerns have been raised by the U.N. and Amnesty International regarding high civilian death tolls. \n\nIslamic State imposed harsh interpretations of Islamic law in Raqqa, with public executions and severe punishments being common. The offensive in Raqqa has led to tensions between the U.S. and Turkey, with concerns regarding potential Kurdish influence over the predominantly Arab city. The YPG, a key U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State, is viewed by Ankara as an extension of the PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization in Turkey. The formation of a Raqqa Civil Council by the SDF's political affiliates, comprising locals from the city, is aimed to assume control post-Islamic State defeat, aligning with the transitional patterns seen in other liberated areas. Efforts have been made to establish a new police force for Raqqa with the assistance of the U.S.-led coalition. Islamic State has antagonized various factions in the long-standing Syrian conflict, with separate offensives targeting its remaining strongholds along the Euphrates river near the Syrian-Iraqi border. Apart from the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iran-backed militias, is also engaged in combating Islamic State in eastern Syria. \n\nRaqqa, once a bustling market town and a hub for transportation, has a rich history dating back to the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century when it served as a capital. The city, inhabited for centuries, boasts significant archaeological and architectural sites, many of which have suffered looting and damage during the war.

{"src_passage": "TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up his tough rhetoric against North Korea when he arrived in Japan on Sunday, saying the United States and its allies are prepared to defend freedom and  no dictator  should underestimate U.S. resolve. Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile tests. He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions, and also singled out trade, which he said had been  badly handled  in the region for years. Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. A top aide said last week Trump intends to tell Asian leaders the world is  running out of time  in dealing with the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.  No dictator, no regime, no nation should ever underestimate American resolve,  Trump told hundreds of cheering U.S. and Japanese troops in camouflage uniforms gathered at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, soon after he arrived.  Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?  said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops. North Korea s recent actions, including several missiles that flew over Japan and Pyongyang s sixth and largest nuclear test, have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump s presidency. Recent drills over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have further heightened tensions.  We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,  Trump said. He told reporters earlier on Air Force One that a decision would be made soon on whether to add reclusive North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism. Trump said his administration planned to take a different approach after years of what he termed  total weakness.    It s a big problem for our country and the world, and we want to get it solved.  In an apparent attempt to distinguish between North Korea s leadership and ordinary people, he said he thought North Koreans were  great people.   And I hope it all works out for everybody.  Abe told reporters before Trump s arrival that he welcomed the visit as a chance to deepen bilateral ties by building on the  friendship and trust  between the two leaders, fostered by several meetings that included a round of golf in Florida earlier this year.  I hope we will be able to have thorough discussions about international issues, including North Korea,  he said. Trump and Abe greeted each other with a handshake at a golf course to be used during the 2020 Olympic Games, changing clothes and heading out to play after what media said was a lunch of hamburgers. In an allusion to a Trump campaign slogan, they signed caps that said  Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.  They discussed North Korea and trade while playing nine holes with Hideki Matsuyama, the world no. 3 pro golfer. A senior White House official said the two leaders have developed a close bond since Trump took office in January.   Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!  Trump tweeted. For his part, Abe took to Twitter to say he played golf  with a marvellous friend (President Donald J. Trump) full of spirited conversation.  The two leaders and their wives later dined on grilled Japanese premium beef at an upscale restaurant. In brief pre-dinner remarks, Trump said U.S.-Japan ties were closer than ever. But he added:  We ll have dinner tonight. I think we ll insult everybody by continuing to talk about trade.  Trump also said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, the longest Asian tour by any U.S. leader since George H.W. Bush in 1992.  I think it s expected that we will meet,  he said.  We want Putin s help on North Korea.  Trump wants a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before he visits Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang. Separately, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed that  now is the time to apply firm pressure on North Korea,  Kono told reporters. A senior U.S. State Department official traveling with Tillerson said the pressure was having an effect.   I think we have a better chance now than we ve had in the last couple of decades to solve this problem because the most important thing is to have the international community completely united in order to really choke off the lifeline for North Korea. It s got to be the way,  the official said. Trade will factor heavily during Trump s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to policies more favorable to the United States, a point Trump emphasized. A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where Trump will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.  One of the things we re going to be very focused on is trade because trade has not been done well for 25 years by the United States with this part of the world, with any part of the world,  he said on Air Force One.

", "predictions": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Upon his arrival in Japan on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump intensified his strong language against North Korea, emphasizing that the United States and its allies stand ready to protect freedom, with a clear warning that no dictator should underestimate U.S. determination. Starting his 12-day Asian journey, Trump aims to demonstrate a unified stance with Japan against North Korea by holding discussions with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amidst escalating tensions due to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile trials. Trump highlighted that North Korea would be a key topic of conversation, along with trade issues that he criticized as mismanaged in the region for many years. His threat to \"completely destroy\" North Korea if it poses a threat to the United States and his labeling of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a \"rocket man\" on a dangerous mission have stirred concern among some allies. In a speech to U.S. and Japanese troops at Yokota Air Base, Trump stressed that American resolve should not be underestimated by any dictator, regime, or nation. He recounted past instances where others miscalculated the U.S., hinting at the repercussions they faced. The recent provocative actions by North Korea, including missile launches over Japan and a significant nuclear test, have raised the urgency of the situation, posing a significant challenge to Trump's presidency. Trump reiterated a firm commitment to defending freedom, refusing to yield or waver. He hinted at imminent decisions regarding North Korea's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, signaling a shift from what he termed as past weakness in handling the situation. Trump expressed admiration for the North Korean people while emphasizing the need for a resolution to the crisis. Abe welcomed the opportunity to enhance bilateral ties with Trump, reflecting on their past interactions and expressing hope for fruitful discussions, particularly on the North Korea issue. The two leaders shared a golf outing with professional golfer Hideki Matsuyama, signing caps with a slogan symbolizing an even greater alliance. Trump plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip and seeks Putin's support on the North Korea matter. Pressure on North Korea was a key topic of discussion between the Japanese Foreign Minister and the U.S. Secretary of State, highlighting the importance of global unity in addressing the issue. Trade concerns loom large as Trump seeks to negotiate better terms for the United States in the region. His upcoming speech at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam is anticipated to focus on promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region as a response to China's expansionist policies. Trump underscored the need for fair and reciprocal trade arrangements during his trip, aiming to secure agreements that benefit the United States."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it. Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East. He accused Iran of  not living up to the spirit  of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon, in effect throwing the fate of the deal to Congress.  He singled out Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of Tehran, which he accused of destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran s nuclear breakout,  Trump said. Trump s hardline remarks drew praise from Israel, Iran s arch-foe, but was criticized by European allies. The move by Trump was part of his  America First  approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. His Iran strategy angered Tehran and put Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with Iran. Responding to Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday on television that Tehran was committed to the deal and accused Trump of making baseless accusations.  The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure,  he said.  Iran and the deal are stronger than ever.  European allies have warned of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as Trump has done undermines U.S. credibility abroad, especially as international inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord.                 The chief of the U.N. atomic watchdog reiterated that Iran was under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime.   The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,  Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, referring to the deal by its formal name. U.S. Democrats expressed skepticism at Trump s decision. Senator Ben Cardin said:  At a moment when the United States and its allies face a nuclear crisis with North Korea, the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners.  While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact. If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker was working on amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act law to include  trigger points  that if crossed by Iran would automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions. The trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, Iran s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal s  sunset clauses  under which some of the restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire over time.  Trump directed U.S. intelligence agencies to probe whether Iran might be working with North Korea on its weapons programs. The president, who took office in January, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as  the worst deal ever.  It was negotiated under his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Trump warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.   We ll see what happens over the next short period of time and I can do that instantaneously,  he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now. The Trump administration designated the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. The administration stopped short of labeling the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a list maintained by the State Department. The Revolutionary Guard is the single most dominant player in Iran s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in Iran s domestic and foreign policies. It had already previously been sanctioned by the United States under other authorities, and the immediate impact of Friday s measure is likely to be symbolic. The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of Trump s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of U.S. forces. But U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and Iran had not responded to Trump s announcement with any provocative acts so far.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker was working on amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act law to include  trigger points  that if crossed by Iran would automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions. The trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, Iran s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal s  sunset clauses  under which some of the restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire over time.  Trump directed U.S. intelligence agencies to probe whether Iran might be working with North Korea on its weapons programs. The president, who took office in January, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as  the worst deal ever.  It was negotiated under his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Trump warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.   We ll see what happens over the next short period of time and I can do that instantaneously,  he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now. The Trump administration designated the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. The administration stopped short of labeling the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a list maintained by the State Department. The Revolutionary Guard is the single most dominant player in Iran s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in Iran s domestic and foreign policies. It had already previously been sanctioned by the United States under other authorities, and the immediate impact of Friday s measure is likely to be symbolic. The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of Trump s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of U.S. forces. But U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and Iran had not responded to Trump s announcement with any provocative acts so far. ", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Trump took a significant step against the 2015 Iran nuclear deal on Friday, going against other global powers by refusing to certify Iran's compliance and suggesting the possibility of ending the agreement. In a speech outlining a tougher stance on Iran's nuclear and missile programs, as well as its backing of extremist groups in the Middle East, Trump accused Iran of failing to uphold the essence of the deal. He emphasized his objective to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, leaving the fate of the agreement to Congress. Trump criticized Iran's actions in various countries and expressed concern over the potential consequences of allowing Iran to advance its nuclear capabilities. While Trump's assertive comments were welcomed by Israel but faced criticism from European allies, his decision reflected his \"America First\" approach to international agreements, aligning with his previous withdrawals from other accords and renegotiations. Trump's strategy regarding Iran drew a negative response from Tehran and created tensions with other nations party to the deal. Despite European warnings of a rift with the U.S. over the agreement, international inspectors confirmed Iran's compliance. The head of the U.N. atomic watchdog affirmed the robust oversight of Iran's nuclear activities and confirmed Iran's adherence to the terms of the deal. Democrats in the U.S. voiced doubt over Trump's move, raising concerns about potential isolation from allies. Trump's decision allowed Congress a 60-day window to consider reapplying economic sanctions on Iran, a move that could jeopardize the agreement. Efforts were underway in Congress to enhance the agreement's terms to include conditions that, if violated by Iran, would lead to the reinstatement of sanctions. Trump also instructed intelligence agencies to investigate potential collaboration between Iran and North Korea on their weapons programs. Emphasizing his dissatisfaction with the deal, Trump maintained the option of terminating it if no satisfactory resolution was reached through cooperation with Congress and allies. The administration's latest measure targeted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps but fell short of categorizing it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The group's significant influence in Iran's affairs makes the impact of this action largely symbolic. The U.S. military, in support of Trump's new strategy, was exploring opportunities to work with allies to exert pressure on Iran, although no immediate changes had been made to military positions, and Iran had not engaged in provocative behavior in response to Trump's announcement."}
{"src_passage": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party broke with recent precedent on Wednesday, unveiling a new leadership line-up without a clear successor to President Xi Jinping, who has become arguably the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing s Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his  vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage.  Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday. All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China s 1949 Communist revolution. The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world s second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favorable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a  team of rivals . The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party s General Office.  Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March. Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and  Belt and Road  infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party s  core  last year. Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party s so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee. Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee.  He s consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,  said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.   The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn t need to do it.  Wang, who led Xi s sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China s second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior.  While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi s chief of staff as director of the party s General Office.  Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,  said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics.  Most of Xi s close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away.  Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People s Daily s WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a  dream team  to lead China into its  new era . Xi, who has sought to revitalize the Communist Party s role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English. Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations.  We will also work with other nations to build a global community with a shared future, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of peace and development for all humanity,  he said.  Xi and Li were first promoted to the Standing Committee at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, in a clear signal that the pair would succeed Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao and occupy the top two  offices - which they did five years later.  Zhao Leji, who headed the party s Organisation Department, which oversees personnel decisions, replaced Wang Qishan as chief of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

This marked the conclusion of a week-long party conference where Xi outlined his vision for a prosperous China asserting its position on the global stage. Premier Li Keqiang was the only member besides Xi who retained his position on the Politburo Standing Committee amidst significant changes. There has been speculation that Xi might seek to extend his tenure beyond the usual second five-year term that began on Wednesday. The composition of the all-male Standing Committee, none of whom were born before the Communist revolution of 1949, seemed to strike a balance between Xi's allies and those loyal to party elders like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Observers noted that this structure resembled a \"team of rivals.\" Xi's close associate, Li Zhanshu, was ranked third and is likely to assume leadership of the parliament, pending confirmation in March. Xi had already solidified his influence with the inclusion of his political ideology and the Belt and Road initiative in the party constitution. While some had expected Hu Chunhua and Chen Miner to be potential successors, they were appointed to the larger Politburo instead of the Standing Committee. Analysts commended Xi for consolidating power strategically and avoiding unnecessary challenges. The new Politburo featured numerous allies of Xi, positioning them for future leadership roles. State media coverage avoided discussing internal politics, focusing instead on portraying the Standing Committee as a \"dream team\" for leading China into a \"new era.\" During the announcement, Xi did not mention a successor, emphasizing international cooperation for global peace and development. Xi and Li's promotion to the Standing Committee in 2007 had signaled their future ascent to the top leadership roles, which they assumed five years later.
