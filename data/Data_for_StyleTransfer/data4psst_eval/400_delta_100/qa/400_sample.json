        "src_passage": "  Classical definitions of locally complete intersection (l.c.i.) homomorphisms\nof commutative rings are limited to maps that are essentially of finite type,\nor flat. The concept introduced in this paper is meaningful for homomorphisms\nphi : R \\longrightarrow S of commutative noetherian rings. It is defined in\nterms of the structure of phi in a formal neighborhood of each point of Spec S.\nWe characterize the l.c.i. property by different conditions on the vanishing of\nthe Andr\\'e-Quillen homology of the R-algebra S. One of these descriptions\nestablishes a very general form of a conjecture of Quillen that was open even\nfor homomorphisms of finite type: If S has a finite resolution by flat\nR-modules and the cotangent complex \\cot SR is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded\ncomplex of flat S-modules, then phi is l.c.i. The proof uses a mixture of\nmethods from commutative algebra, differential graded homological algebra, and\nhomotopy theory. The l.c.i. property is shown to be stable under a variety of\noperations, including composition, decomposition, flat base change,\nlocalization, and completion. The present framework allows for the results to\nbe stated in proper generality; many of them are new even with classical\nassumptions. For instance, the stability of l.c.i. homomorphisms under\ndecomposition settles an open case in Fulton's treatment of orientations of\nmorphisms of schemes.\n",

        "src_passage": "  We present a survey strategy to detect the neutral hydrogen (HI) power\nspectrum at $5<z<6$ using the SKA-Low radio telescope in presence of\nforegrounds and instrumental effects. We simulate observations of the\ninherently weak HI signal post-reionization with varying levels of noise and\ncontamination with foreground amplitudes equivalent to residuals after sky\nmodel subtraction. We find that blind signal separation methods on imaged data\nare required in order to recover the HI signal at large cosmological scales.\nComparing different methods of foreground cleaning, we find that Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR) performs better than Principle Component Analysis\n(PCA), with the key difference being that GPR uses smooth kernels for the total\ndata covariance. The integration time of one field needs to be larger than\n$\\sim 250$ h to provide large enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to accurately\nmodel the data covariance for foreground cleaning.

        "src_passage": "  It is shown that a broad class of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED)\nproblems - which consider the resonant propagation of a single photon\ninteracting with quantum emitters (QEs), such as atoms, quantum dots, or\nvacancy centers - can be solved directly without application of the second\nquantization formalism. In the developed approach, the Hamiltonian is expressed\nthrough the ket-bra products of collective (photon + cavities + QEs) states.\nConsequently, the S-matrix of input-output problems is determined exactly by\nthe Mahaux-Weidenm\\\"uller formula, which dramatically simplifies the analysis\nof complex cavity QED systems. First, this approach is illustrated for the\nproblem of propagation of a photon resonantly interacting with N two-level QEs\narbitrary distributed inside the optical cavity. Solution of this problem\nmanifests the effect of cumulative action of QEs previously known for special\ncases. Can a similar cumulative action of QEs enhance the inelastic resonant\ntransmission of a single photon? We solve this problem for the case of an\noptical cavity having two modes resonantly coupled to electronic transitions of\nN three-level QEs. It is shown that the described structure is the simplest\nrealistic structure which enables the down-conversion of the single photon\nfrequency with the amplitude approaching unity in the absence of the external\ndriving field and for sufficiently small cavity losses and QE dissipation.\nOverall, the simplicity and generality of the developed approach suggest a\npractical way to identify and describe new phenomena in cavity QED.\n",

        "src_passage": "PHOENIX (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Tuesday he might terminate the NAFTA trade treaty with Mexico and Canada after three-way talks failed to bridge deep differences. The United States, Canada and Mexico wrapped up their first round of talks on Sunday to revamp the trade pact with little sign of a breakthrough coming. Trump reopened negotiations of the 1994 treaty out of concern U.S. economic interests were suffering. “Personally, I don’t think we can make a deal. I think we’ll probably end up terminating NAFTA at some point,” Trump said at a political rally in Phoenix, Arizona. Suggesting a termination might help jumpstart the negotiations, Trump said: “I personally don’t think you can make a deal without a termination.” Following Trump’s remarks, Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray tweeted: “No surprises: we’re already in a negotiation. Mexico will remain at the table with serenity, firmness and with the national interest ahead.” In a joint statement issued at the end of five days of negotiations in Washington, the top trade officials from the three countries said Mexico would host the next round of talks from Sept. 1 to 5. The talks will move to Canada later in September, then return to the United States in October, with additional rounds planned for later this year. ",

        "src_passage": "(Reuters) - A Texas judge identified by Donald Trump on Wednesday as one of 11 people he would consider nominating to the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly mocked the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on social media.  Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett last month likened Trump to “Star Wars” villain Darth Vader in a Twitter post.  \"'We'll rebuild the Death Star. It'll be amazing, believe me. And the rebels will pay for it.' —Darth Trump,\" Willett tweeted last month with a photo of the Death Star, the giant spherical spaceship built to carry a planet-destroying weapon in the first \"Star Wars\" movie.  Willett also linked Trump to liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  “Can’t wait till Trump rips off his face Mission Impossible-style & reveals a laughing Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” Willett posted on Twitter last August.  Last June he mocked Trump’s judgment on picking a nominee to the high court.  “Donald Trump haiku— Who would the Donald Name to #SCOTUS? The mind reels. *weeps—can’t finish tweet*” tweeted Willett (@JusticeWillett) on the same day Trump launched his candidacy. SCOTUS refers to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Asked to comment on Willett’s Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, “Mr. Trump’s sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.”  Alabama U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a key Trump backer, was asked on Fox News Channel about the judge’s Twitter posts, replying, “I doubt he cares.” Sessions said it was more important to ask whether Willett “follows the Constitution,” is a good scholar, has integrity and meets the high standards expected of a Supreme Court justice.  Willett’s enthusiastic tweeting would be a pivot from the current social media presence of Supreme Court justices. None of the eight sitting justices has a verified Twitter account.  Willett did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.  ",

        "src_passage": "  Human lives are increasingly influenced by algorithms, which therefore need\nto meet higher standards not only in accuracy but also with respect to\nexplainability. This is especially true for high-stakes areas such as real\nestate valuation. Unfortunately, the methods applied there often exhibit a\ntrade-off between accuracy and explainability.\n  One explainable approach is case-based reasoning (CBR), where each decision\nis supported by specific previous cases. However, such methods can be wanting\nin accuracy. The unexplainable machine learning approaches are often observed\nto provide higher accuracy but are not scrutable in their decision-making.\n  In this paper, we apply evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to CBR predictors in\norder to improve their performance. In particular, we deploy EAs to the\nsimilarity functions (used in CBR to find comparable cases), which are fitted\nto the data set at hand. As a consequence, we achieve higher accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), while keeping interpretability\nand explainability.\n  These results stem from our empirical evaluation on a large data set of real\nestate offers where we compare known similarity functions, their EA-improved\ncounterparts, and DNNs. Surprisingly, DNNs are only on par with standard CBR\ntechniques. However, using EA-learned similarity functions does yield an\nimproved performance.\n",

        "src_passage": "LA PAZ (Reuters) - More than half the ballots cast in Bolivia s judicial elections on Sunday were spoiled, or nullified, by voters, a sign that the opposition said showed dwindling support for President Evo Morales. Tensions are high in Bolivia after the Constitutional Court last week gave Morales the green light to run for a fourth straight term in 2019. Morales  opponents encouraged voters to spoil their ballots in protest of the ruling. Morales, a former coca farmer in power since 2006, had previously accepted the results of a referendum in 2016, when 51 percent of voters rejected his proposal to end term limits.   The citizens have defeated Evo Morales, a leader who is trying to impose re-election on Bolivia, along with corruption and the manipulation of the justice system,  businessman and former presidential candidate Samuel Doria Medina Tweeted. The 26 judges elected on Sunday will be seated in January. Morales said in a news conference on Monday that the high number of spoiled ballots should not be seen as a protest against him, but as an attempt by the opposition to block his plan for a judiciary with elected rather than appointed judges.  The unpatriotic right wing wanted the election of an organic judiciary to fail, but the people have elected their authorities; judges who answer to the people, not to politicians,  Morales said. The 96 candidates on the ballot were preselected by Congress, where Morales has a majority. Opposition leaders said the vote was a ploy to give Morales supporters control over the electoral court. Ballots were spoiled by marking more than one candidate, scratching or ripping the papers or doodling on them.  A preliminary report by Bolivia s elections authority said 78 percent of the country s 6.4 million eligible voters participated in the election and that more than 50 percent of the ballots cast were spoiled.

        "src_passage": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russian air strikes killed 21 people in a village on the eastern side of the Euphrates River in east Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday. The strikes in Deir al-Zor province were to support the Kurdish-led U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighting Islamic State, which had attempted to launch an attack on the town earlier this week, the war monitor said. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in the province mainly in support of the Syrian army which, alongside allied Shi ite militias, has been waging its own assault against Islamic State on the western side of the Euphrates. The separate assaults have advanced along opposite sides of the river, which bisects oil-rich Deir al-Zor, mostly staying out of each other s way. The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have held deconfliction meetings to prevent clashes between them, though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict. The Observatory also reported on Wednesday that the Syrian army and its allied forces had  finished the presence of Islamic State  on the western bank of the river. On Sunday, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which spearheads the SDF, announced it had fully captured Deir al-Zor s eastern countryside from Islamic State with the help of both the U.S.-led coalition and Russia.

        "src_passage": "  In line with Pomeau's conjecture about the relevance of directed percolation\n(DP) to turbulence onset/decay in wall-bounded flows, we propose a minimal\nstochastic model dedicated to the interpretation of the spatially intermittent\nregimes observed in channel flow before its return to laminar flow. Numerical\nsimulations show that a regime with bands obliquely drifting in two stream-wise\nsymmetrical directions bifurcates into an asymmetrical regime, before\nultimately decaying to laminar flow. The model is expressed in terms of a\nprobabilistic cellular automaton evolving von Neumann neighbourhoods with\nprobabilities educed from a close examination of simulation results. It\nimplements band propagation and the two main local processes: longitudinal\nsplitting involving bands with the same orientation, and transversal splitting\ngiving birth to a daughter band with orientation opposite to that of its\nmother. The ultimate decay stage observed to display one-dimensional DP\nproperties in a two-dimensional geometry is interpreted as resulting from the\nirrelevance of lateral spreading in the single-orientation regime. The model\nalso reproduces the bifurcation restoring the symmetry upon variation of the\nprobability attached to transversal splitting, which opens the way to a study\nof the critical properties of that bifurcation, in analogy with thermodynamic\nphase transitions.\n",

        "src_passage": "  The outer gap model is used here to explain the spectrum and the energy\ndependent light curves of the X-ray and soft gamma-ray radiations of the\nspin-down powered pulsar PSR B1509-58.In the outer gap model, most pairs inside\nthe gap are created around the null charge surface and the gap's electric field\nseparates the two charges to move in opposite directions. Consequently, the\nregion from the null charge surface to the light cylinder is dominated by the\noutflow of particles and that from the null charge surface to the star is\ndominated by the inflow of particles. The inflow and outflow of particles move\nalong the magnetic field lines and emit curvature photons, and the incoming\ncurvature photons are converted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the\nstar. These pairs emit synchrotron photons. We suggest that the X-rays and soft\ngamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these\npairs, and the viewing angle of PSR B1509-58 only receives the inflow\nradiation. The magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes\nthe pulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the\ncurvature radiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron\nradiation with different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the\nlight curves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of\nthe secondary pairs, and the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the\nregion near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows the pair\ncreation to happen with a smaller pitch angle.\n",

In order to ensure that longitudinal compression and/or transverse\nfocusing of the laser pulse is not needed before the wake can self-trap the\nplasma electrons, we have employed the ionization injection technique.\nFurthermore, the plasma density is varied such that at the lowest densities,\nthe laser pulse occupies only a fraction of the first wavelength of the wake\noscillation (the accelerating bucket), whereas at the highest density, the same\nduration laser pulse fills the entire first bucket. Although the trapped\nelectrons execute betatron oscillations due to the ion column in all cases, at\nthe lowest plasma density they do not interact with the laser field and the\nenergy gain is all due to the longitudinal wakefield. However, as the density\nis increased, there can be a significant contribution to the maximum energy due\nto direct laser acceleration (DLA) of those electrons that undergo betatron\nmotion in the plane of the polarization of the laser pulse. Eventually, DLA can\nbe the dominant energy gain mechanism over acceleration due to the longitudinal\nfield at the highest densities.\n",

        "src_passage": "  We analyze a low energy effective model of Dark Matter in which the thermal\nrelic density is provided by a singlet Majorana fermion which interacts with\nthe Higgs fields via higher dimensional operators. Direct detection signatures\nmay be reduced if blind spot solutions exist, which naturally appear in models\nwith extended Higgs sectors. Explicit mass terms for the Majorana fermion can\nbe forbidden by a $Z_3$ symmetry, which in addition leads to a reduction of the\nnumber of higher dimensional operators. Moreover, a weak scale mass for the\nMajorana fermion is naturally obtained from the vacuum expectation value of a\nscalar singlet field. The proper relic density may be obtained by the\n$s$-channel interchange of Higgs and gauge bosons, with the longitudinal mode\nof the $Z$ boson (the neutral Goldstone mode) playing a relevant role in the\nannihilation process. This model shares many properties with the\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (NMSSM) with\nlight singlinos and heavy scalar and gauge superpartners. In order to test the\nvalidity of the low energy effective field theory, we compare its predictions\nwith those of the ultraviolet complete NMSSM. Extending our framework to\ninclude $Z_3$ neutral Majorana fermions, analogous to the bino in the NMSSM, we\nfind the appearance of a new bino-singlino well tempered Dark Matter region.\n",

        "src_passage": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Tayyip Erdogan will travel to Greece on Dec. 7-8, Greek sources said on Friday, in the first visit by a Turkish president in decades that have seen ties at times severely strained over issues from Aegean Sea rights to ethnically-split Cyprus. Erdogan is expected to meet his Greek counterpart and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and discuss bilateral relations, security issues and the refugee crisis, following a 2016 EU-Ankara deal aimed at reducing migrant flows to Europe.  He is also expected to visit Thrace in northern Greece, where there is a Muslim minority. Erdogan last visited fellow NAT member Greece in 2010 in his capacity as  prime minister. His visit next week will be the first by a Turkish president to Greece in 65 years.  Greece and Turkey, NATO allies, came to the brink of war in 1996 over the ownership of uninhabited Aegean islets.  Relations have improved since then but they are still at odds over issues from territorial disputes to Cyprus, which remains divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities living on either side of a U.N.-monitored ceasefire line.  Eight Turkish soldiers commandeered a helicopter and flew it to northern Greece as a failed coup unfolded against Erdogan between July 15 and 16, 2016. Turkey has repeatedly demanded Greece hand them over but Greece s highest court has rejected their extradition. Greek police on Tuesday arrested nine Turkish citizens who were later charged with terrorism-related offences. They are accused of hoarding explosives and of links to an outlawed militant organization responsible for suicide bombings in Turkey. They have denied any wrongdoing. [nL8N1NZ39F] ",

        "src_passage": "  Self-consistent, time-dependent supernova (SN) simulations in three spatial\ndimensions (3D) are conducted with the Aenus-Alcar code, comparing, for the\nfirst time, calculations with fully multi-dimensional (FMD) neutrino transport\nand the ray-by-ray-plus (RbR+) approximation, both based on a two-moment solver\nwith algebraic M1 closure. We find good agreement between 3D results with FMD\nand RbR+ transport for both tested grid resolutions in the cases of a 20\nsolar-mass progenitor, which does not explode with the employed simplified set\nof neutrino opacities, and of an exploding 9 solar-mass model. This is in stark\ncontrast to corresponding axisymmetric (2D) simulations, which confirm previous\nclaims that the RbR+ approximation can foster explosions in 2D in particular in\nmodels with powerful axial sloshing of the stalled shock due to the standing\naccretion shock instability (SASI). However, while local and instantaneous\nvariations of neutrino fluxes and heating rates can still be considerably\nhigher with RbR+ transport in 3D, the time-averaged quantities are very similar\nto FMD results because of the absence of a fixed, artificial symmetry axis that\nchannels the flow. Therefore, except for stochastic fluctuations, the neutrino\nsignals and the post-bounce evolution of 3D simulations with FMD and RbR+\ntransport are also very similar, in particular for our calculations with the\nbetter grid resolution. Higher spatial resolution has clearly a more important\nimpact than the differences by the two transport treatments. Our results back\nup the use of the RbR+ approximation for neutrino transport in 3D SN modeling.\n",

        "src_passage": "  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Among different\nattack settings, the most challenging yet the most practical one is the\nhard-label setting where the attacker only has access to the hard-label output\n(prediction label) of the target model. Previous attempts are neither effective\nenough in terms of attack success rate nor efficient enough in terms of query\ncomplexity under the widely used $L_\\infty$ norm threat model. In this paper,\nwe present the Ray Searching attack (RayS), which greatly improves the\nhard-label attack effectiveness as well as efficiency. Unlike previous works,\nwe reformulate the continuous problem of finding the closest decision boundary\ninto a discrete problem that does not require any zeroth-order gradient\nestimation. In the meantime, all unnecessary searches are eliminated via a fast\ncheck step. This significantly reduces the number of queries needed for our\nhard-label attack. Moreover, interestingly, we found that the proposed RayS\nattack can also be used as a sanity check for possible \"falsely robust\" models.\nOn several recently proposed defenses that claim to achieve the\nstate-of-the-art robust accuracy, our attack method demonstrates that the\ncurrent white-box/black-box attacks could still give a false sense of security\nand the robust accuracy drop between the most popular PGD attack and RayS\nattack could be as large as $28\\%$. We believe that our proposed RayS attack\ncould help identify falsely robust models that beat most white-box/black-box\nattacks.\n",

        "src_passage": "LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton wants Britain to stay in the European Union, her campaign said on Saturday, following an intervention from U.S. President Barack Obama who urged Britons to vote to remain. “Hillary Clinton believes that transatlantic cooperation is essential, and that cooperation is strongest when Europe is united. She has always valued a strong United Kingdom in a strong EU. And she values a strong British voice in the EU,” Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement provided to Reuters.  Clinton, who spent four years as U.S. secretary of state during Obama’s first term, has made her foreign policy credentials a central piece of her campaign for president in the November 2016 race for the White House.  Clinton’s position on the EU was first reported by Britain’s Observer newspaper.  Obama, who will leave Britain on Sunday, sparked a row during his three-day trip by bluntly telling Britain it should remain in the European Union to preserve its remaining global clout. He angered critics of the EU on Friday by warning that Britain would be at “the back of the queue” for a trade deal if it left the club - one of the strongest U.S. interventions in the affairs of a western European democracy since the Cold War.

        "src_passage": "  During the evolution of rotating first stars, which initially consisted of\nonly hydrogen and helium, CNO elements may emerge to their surface. These stars\nmay therefore have winds that are driven only by CNO elements. We study weak\nwind effects (Gayley-Owocki heating and multicomponent effects) in stellar\nwinds of first generation stars driven purely by CNO elements. We apply our\nNLTE multicomponent models and hydrodynamical simulations. The multicomponent\neffects (frictional heating and decoupling) are important particularly for low\nmetallicity winds, but they influence mass loss rate only if they cause\ndecoupling for velocities lower than the escape velocity. The multicomponent\neffects also modify the feedback from first stars. As a result of the\ndecoupling of radiatively accelerated metals from hydrogen and helium, the\nfirst low-energy cosmic ray particles are generated. We study the interaction\nof these particles with the interstellar medium concluding that these particles\neasily penetrate the interstellar medium of a given minihalo. We discuss the\ncharging of the first stars by means of their winds. Gayley-Owocki heating,\nfrictional heating, and the decoupling of wind components occur in the winds of\nevolved low-metallicity stars and the solar metallicity main-sequence stars.\n",

        "src_passage": "AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Former Democratic U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Sunday in one of his first major speeches since leaving office this year that he would have liked to have been the U.S. president who ended cancer as we know it. Biden, whose son Beau died from brain cancer in 2015, delivered an emotional speech at the South by Southwest technology summit in Austin, Texas, about continuing the work he led under former Democratic President Barack Obama in the so-called “Cancer Moonshot,” an initiative aimed at speeding up research into new cancer therapies. He spoke of the need for prevention, research collaboration and big data to battle cancer. Biden did not mention U.S. Republican President Donald Trump by name but said in the speech before several thousand people he was willing to work with the current administration on the fight against cancer, which kills an estimated 600,000 Americans a year. “The only bipartisan thing left in America is the fight against cancer,” he said. Biden said that just before he made his formal announcement in 2015 not to run, Obama asked him if he had any regrets.  Biden said he told Obama: “I would have loved to have been the president who presided over the end of cancer as we know it.” He said in the months that followed his son’s death, he did not have the stomach to run for president. “No one should ever run for president of the United States unless they are prepared to give every, every ounce of their energy,” he said. He praised Republicans for working with Democrats on the fight against cancer while he was in office. He had one slight dig at the Trump administration by suggesting some “in the new outfit” do not abide by research on global warming. “I shouldn’t have said that but it frustrates me,” he said. ",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prospects dimmed on Monday for the U.S. House of Representatives to vote this week on Republican legislation to restrict gun sales to suspected extremists before Congress goes on a seven-week summer break.  Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Congress begins a summer recess on Friday. But with the House floor schedule filling with other bills, Republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before September, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.   Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, “I do not anticipate that bill.” The measure, backed by the National Rifle Association, would give government authorities three days to convince a judge to block the sale of weapons to someone suspected of involvement in violent extremism. But Ryan has been unable to win support from conservative Republicans who say the measure poses potential constitutional problems and should be subjected to regular legislative channels including formal hearings. Republican lawmakers say discussions aimed at finding compromise are continuing. But the measure did not come up at a Monday meeting with Republican leaders to discuss the week’s agenda, said another lawmaker who predicted it would not see a vote this week.   The stalemate leaves hanging Democratic demands for stronger gun restrictions, despite an unprecedented 25-hour sit-in by House Democrats last month, and sidelines any potential movement on an alternative bipartisan bill seen as a possible compromise. “A vote is going to be stalled” until Congress returns from its long summer break, one Republican aide said. Lawmakers initially believed Congress could pass some kind of measure before their summer recess after the Orlando shootings raised national security concerns and polls showed a majority of Americans in favor of greater restrictions.

        "src_passage": "  Optical tweezers microrheology (OTM) offers a powerful approach to probe the\nnonlinear response of complex soft matter systems, such as networks of\nentangled polymers, over wide-ranging spatiotemporal scales. OTM can also\nuniquely characterize the microstructural dynamics that lead to the intriguing\nnonlinear rheological properties that these systems exhibit. However, the\nstrain in OTM measurements, applied by optically forcing a micro-probe through\nthe material, induces network inhomogeneities in and around the strain path,\nand the resultant flow field complicates the measured response of the system.\nThrough a robust set of custom-designed OTM protocols, coupled with modeling\nand analytical calculations, we characterize the time-varying inhomogeneity\nfields induced by OTM measurements. We show that post-strain homogenization\ndoes not interfere with the intrinsic stress relaxation dynamics of the system,\nrather it manifests as an independent component in the stress decay, even in\nhighly nonlinear regimes such as with the microrheological-LAOS (mLAOS)\nprotocols we introduce. Our specific results show that Rouse-like elastic\nretraction, rather than disentanglement and disengagement, dominates the\nnonlinear stress relaxation of entangled polymers at micro- and meso- scales.\nThus, our study opens up possibilities of performing precision nonlinear\nmicrorheological measurements, such as mLAOS, on a wide range of complex\nmacromolecular systems.\n",

        "src_passage": "  We investigate the effects of gravitational lensing in the binary pulsar\nsystem J0737-3039. Current measurement of the orbital inclination allows the\nmillisecond pulsar (A) to pass very close (at R_{min}=4000 km) in projection to\nthe companion pulsar (B), with R_{min} comparable to the Einstein radius (2600\nkm). For this separation at the conjunction, lensing causes small (about 10%)\nmagnification of the pulsar A signal on a timescale of several seconds, and\ndisplaces the pulsar image on the sky plane by about 1200 km. More importantly,\nlensing introduces a correction (of several microsec) to the conventional\nShapiro delay formula used in pulsar timing analysis, and gives rise to a\ngeometric time delay together with the delays associated with the pulsar spin\nperiod. These lensing effects can influence the determination of the system\nparameters by both timing and scintillation studies. Given the current\nuncertainty in the orbital inclination, more extreme manifestations of lensing\n(e.g. magnification by a factor of several) are possible. We compare our\npredictions with the existing observations and discuss the possibility of\ndetecting gravitational lensing signatures in the system. The anomalously high\npoint in A's lightcurve close to superior conjunction might be caused by\ngravitational lensing.\n",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulations, proposed by the Treasury to crack down on companies that try to reduce taxes by rebasing abroad, have begun a White House review and could be finalized shortly, officials said on Tuesday. The regulations, which would make it difficult for U.S. business operations to avoid taxation while shifting profits overseas through a practice called “earnings stripping,” were received by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last week. The agency has up to 90 days to decide whether the rules should be finalized or returned to Treasury for further consideration. “We are satisfied we have addressed stakeholder feedback and are close to issuing final earnings stripping regulations,” a Treasury spokesperson said. The Obama administration has faced widespread criticism from the business community over its regulatory assault on tax inversions, which are tax-driven mergers in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller, foreign business in a low-tax country and shifts its headquarters there, if only on paper, to avoid higher U.S. taxes.    Business and industry groups have threatened lawsuits and called for the new rules to be withdrawn or heavily revised because of what critics say is the potential for unintended harm to business. Members of Congress have also accused the administration of overstepping its legal authority. Earnings stripping occurs when an inverted company eludes U.S. taxes on its domestic operation by shifting profits overseas in the form of tax-deductible interest payments to its foreign parent. The new rules would change certain interest payments into equity dividends, which are not tax deductible in the United States.  The regulations were proposed in April, along with a temporary rule to prevent serial inversion deals by foreign companies. That rule, which is already the target of a lawsuit, has not yet been forwarded to OMB. ",

        "src_passage": "= Genetic code =\n\nThe genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded within genetic material ( DNA or mRNA sequences ) is translated into proteins by living cells . Translation is accomplished by the ribosome , which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA , using transfer RNA ( tRNA ) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time . The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries .\nThe code defines how sequences of nucleotide triplets , called codons , specify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis . With some exceptions , a three @-@ nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid . Because the vast majority of genes are encoded with exactly the same code ( see the RNA codon table ) , this particular code is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code , or simply the genetic code , though in fact some variant codes have evolved . For example , protein synthesis in human mitochondria relies on a genetic code that differs from the standard genetic code .\nWhile the \" genetic code \" determines a protein 's amino acid sequence , other genomic regions determine when and where these proteins are produced according to a multitude of more complex \" gene regulatory codes \" .\n\n= = Discovery = =\n\nSerious efforts to understand how proteins are encoded began after the structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 . George Gamow postulated that sets of three bases must be employed to encode the 20 standard amino acids used by living cells to build proteins . With four different nucleotides , a code of 2 nucleotides would allow for only a maximum of 42",

The aid workers are from the French organization Solidarites International and had been kidnapped on Sunday while traveling on a road near the city of Raja, in the west of the country.   All of them were released and they have landed safely in Wau,  another city in the west of the country, a United Nations official in Juba who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters. He said one of those who had been held by the rebels was a foreigner.  Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told Reuters that the six humanitarian aid workers had been freed:  All their belongings were given back to them including their vehicles.  It was not clear why the rebels had taken the aid workers and their vehicles into custody. Solidarites said in a statement on Monday that it had lost contact with three members of its team on Saturday. [L8N1OI50M] It gave no indication of their fate and it was not immediately clear why it gave a different number of those involved.  The spokesman for Solidarites in Paris did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement of the release of its staff. The army spokesman in Juba also did not respond to request for comment. South Sudan is one of the world s most dangerous countries for aid workers. Some 28 aid workers have been killed this year, with nine shot dead in November alone, according to the United Nations. The world s youngest nation is embroiled in a civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people and forced a third of the 12 million strong population to flee their homes.  ",

        "src_passage": "  Cities have recognized the local impact of small craft breweries, in many\nways altering municipal codes to make it easier to establish breweries and\nmaking them the anchor points of economic development and revitalization.\nNevertheless, we do not know the extent to which these strategies impacted\nchanges at the neighborhood level across the nation. In this chapter, we\nexamine the relationship between growth and locations of craft breweries and\nthe incidence of neighborhood change across the United States. In the first\npart of the chapter, we rely on a unique dataset of geocoded brewery locations\nthat tracks openings and closings from 2004 to the present. Using measures of\nneighborhood change often found in literature on gentrification-related topics,\nwe develop statistical models relying on census tract demographic and\nemployment data to determine the extent to which brewery locations are\nassociated with social and demographic shifts since 2000. The strongest\npredictor of whether a craft brewery opened in 2013 or later in a neighborhood\nwas the presence of a prior brewery. We do not find evidence entirely\nconsistent with the common narrative of a link between gentrification and craft\nbrewing, but we see a link between an influx of lower-to-middle income urban\ncreatives and the introduction of a craft breweries. We advocate for urban\nplanners to recognize the importance of craft breweries in neighborhood\nrevitalization while also protecting residents from potential displacement.\n",
