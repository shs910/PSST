{"src_passage":"  Thank you. \nHi, everybody. \nI'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. \nI might look successful and happy being in front of you today, but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair. \nThe violin, which meant everything to me, became a grave burden on me. \nAlthough many people tried to comfort and encourage me, their words sounded like meaningless noise. \nWhen I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, I started to rediscover the true power of music. \n In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul. \nThe comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. \nDo you feel like you are all alone? \nI hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart, as it did for me. \n  Thank you. \nNow, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries. \nMy audience is anyone who is here to listen, even those who are not familiar with classical music. \nI not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few. \nNow, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you. \nLet me introduce you to my brand new project, \"Baroque in Rock,\" which became a golden disc most recently. \nIt's such an honor for me. \nI think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician, I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined. \nBut it's now your turn. \nChanging your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world. \nJust play your life with all you have, and share it with the world. \nI really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters. \nPlay your life, and stay tuned. \n","predictions":"  Thank you. \nHi, everybody. \nI'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. \nI might look successful and happy being in front of you today, but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair. \nThe violin, which meant everything to me, became a grave burden on me. \nAlthough many people tried to comfort and encourage me, their words sounded like meaningless noise. \nWhen I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, I started to rediscover the true power of music. \n In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul. \nThe comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. \nDo you feel like you are all alone? \nI hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart, as it did for me. \n  Thank you. \nNow, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries. \nMy audience is anyone who is here to listen, even those who are not familiar with classical music. \nI not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few. \nNow, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you. \nLet me introduce you to my brand new project, \"Baroque in Rock,\" which became a golden disc most recently. \nIt's such an honor for me. \nI think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician, I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined. \nBut it's now your turn. \nChanging your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world. \nJust play your life with all you have, and share it with the world. \nI really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters. \nPlay your life, and stay tuned. \n","num_tokens":527,"num_sentence":24}
{"src_passage":"Everything is interconnected. \nAs a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this. \nWe are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. \nWhen I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. \nThere were no clouds in the sky. \nAnd after a while I began to perspire. \nAnd he pointed up to the sky, and he said, \"Look, do you see that? \nThat's part of you up there. \nThat's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals.\" \nIn my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, \"Mom, you should do that.\" \nAnd so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do. \nThese clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere. \nThey can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them. \nStorm chasing is a very tactile experience. \nThere's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles. \nAnd then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues. \nI've learned to respect the lightning. \nMy hair used to be straight. \n I'm just kidding. \n What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds. \nThey become lovely monsters. \nWhen I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson. \nAs I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet. \nAll my relations.
