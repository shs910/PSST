Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques can bridge the gap between the underlying physics of the process, processing parameters, and clad characteristics. In this research, a hybrid method is introduced, combining data from a calibrated multi-physics computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model and empirical studies to build a comprehensive dataset. This dataset encompasses vital clad attributes, such as dimensions (width, height, and depth), quality markers, and processing parameters. Two sets of processing parameters - machine settings and physics-informed parameters - are utilized to train various ML models, alongside robust evaluation metrics, establishing a versatile and scalable framework for predicting clad geometry and quality.

{"src_passage": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of steel makers rallied on Wednesday after a rocky start to U.S.-China economic talks raised expectations that President Donald Trump would impose tariffs on steel imports. The S&P 1500 steel index .SPCOMSTEEL jumped 2.3 percent to its highest level since early May. U.S. Steel (X.N) rose 4.9 percent, AK Steel (AKS.N) gained 3.6 percent and Nucor (NUE.N) climbed 2.2 percent.    In opening remarks at an annual summer dialogue between Washington and Beijing, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross criticized China’s $347 billion trade surplus with the United States.      Ross’s comments heightened expectations on Wall Street that Trump would follow through on threats to apply new tariffs to remedy a “big problem” of steel dumping from China and others. “Investors are essentially handicapping a probability that Trump will announce a broad-based anti-dumping measure on steel imports,” said Longbow Research analyst Christopher Olin. Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a “Section 232” review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if  national security is threatened.

This allows for the assessment of jet and accretion powers relative to the Eddington luminosity for numerous blazars, revealing intriguing initial findings. It appears that blazar jets often possess powers on par with or even surpassing the luminosity emitted by their accretion disk. These jets are observed across various accretion rates, with their manifestation influenced by whether the accretion process is radiatively efficient or not. The primary driver of jet power seems to be the movement of matter in bulk rather than the Poynting flux, particularly in the region where the majority of the emission is generated, approximately 1000 Schwarzschild radii away. The process responsible for the creation of relativistic jets appears to be remarkably efficient, potentially more so than accretion, although the latter still likely plays a pivotal role. Notably, the black hole masses of the most powerful jets at a redshift of around 3 surpass one billion solar masses, indicating a significant presence of massive black holes at these redshifts."}

Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Congress begins a summer recess on Friday. But with the House floor schedule filling with other bills, Republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before September, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.

Pressure has mounted on Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, to address gun control following the tragic mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida on June 12. With the House agenda filling up with various bills, it seems improbable that the gun legislation will be addressed before September. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, expressed doubt about the bill's prospects. The proposed measure, supported by the National Rifle Association, aims to permit authorities three days to convince a judge to block weapon sales to suspected extremists. However, resistance from conservative Republicans, who raise concerns about potential constitutional issues and advocate for formal legislative processes including hearings, has hindered progress. Despite ongoing discussions to seek a compromise, the legislation was not part of a Monday meeting with Republican leaders discussing the week's agenda, indicating it is unlikely to be voted on this week. This impasse has led to a stalemate, delaying Democratic calls for stricter gun control measures, even after House Democrats staged a 25-hour sit-in last month. Any movement on an alternative bipartisan bill is also on hold. A Republican staffer noted that a vote on the issue will likely be postponed until Congress reconvenes after the lengthy summer break. Initially, lawmakers were optimistic about passing some form of legislation before the recess, following heightened concerns about national security post-Orlando shootings and favorable public opinion towards stricter gun laws."}

One U.S. soldier died in the assault, and a Pentagon spokesman alleged some of the women were firing at the U.S. force. “The raid ... is a good example of what not to do,” ICG’s senior Arabian Pensinsula analyst April Alley wrote. “The use of U.S. troops and the high number of civilian casualties ... are deeply inflammatory and breed anti-American resentment across the Yemeni political spectrum that works to the advantage of AQAP,” she added. Nearly two years of civil war in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country has allowed local branches of al Qaeda and Islamic State to expand and carry out new attacks within Yemen. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is one of the global militant group’s most active branches. It unsuccessfully plotted to blow up U.S.-bound airliners and claimed responsibility for a 2015 shooting at the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. Former President Barack Obama repeatedly killed top leaders in the organization with unmanned drone attacks but, ICG said, that strategy may not ultimately defeat it. “It is too early to determine what, if any, broader strategy the Trump administration has in Yemen ... (But drone strikes) have failed to stop its rapid growth – in large part because the opportunities provided by the war outstrip its losses.” ", "predictions": "In a recent operation authorized by newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump, a commando raid in Yemen may have inadvertently boosted al Qaeda's propaganda by resulting in civilian casualties, according to a report by the International Crisis Group (ICG). The attack, carried out by Navy SEALs using helicopters, led to the deaths of 30 individuals, including 10 women and children, in a residential area in Yemen's southern al-Bayda province. Al Qaeda claimed that a senior leader and several other militants were among those killed. The Pentagon reported the death of one U.S. soldier during the mission and suggested that some women engaged in combat against the U.S. forces. ICG's senior analyst for the Arabian Peninsula, April Alley, criticized the raid as a misguided action that has led to a high number of civilian casualties, further stoking anti-American sentiments among various Yemeni factions, which ultimately benefit AQAP. The prolonged civil conflict in Yemen has allowed local branches of terrorist groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State to thrive, with AQAP being particularly active. Despite former President Barack Obama's targeted drone strikes that eliminated key AQAP leaders, ICG doubts that this approach alone will defeat the organization. The report emphasizes the need for a comprehensive strategy in Yemen by the Trump administration, as the current tactics have not effectively curbed the group's expansion due to the ongoing conflict creating opportunities that outweigh their losses."}

Optimal conditions for producing attosecond pulses from a narrowband seeding X-ray field are identified, with options to enhance pulse shape at the expense of reduced peak intensity.

In the previous works, denoted as Paper I and Paper II, we delved into the repercussions of dust absorption. In this current paper, we expand our modeling to encompass the implications of light scattering as well. We discuss the integration of kinematical data with the radiative transfer equation and introduce a sophisticated Monte Carlo algorithm capable of effectively handling kinematical data.\nWhen incorporating scattering alongside absorption, we discover that dust attenuation significantly influences the observed motion patterns, particularly at large projected distances. At the central lines of sight, dust can either diminish or augment the observed velocity dispersion. The primary impact of dust attenuation is observed at extended projected distances, where the motion patterns are heavily influenced by photons redirected towards these lines of sight, emitted by fast-moving stars in the galaxy's central areas. These photons distort the Line-Of-Sight Velocity Distributions (LOSVDs) towards higher velocities and notably elevate the observed velocity dispersion and shape parameters of the LOSVDs. These effects bear resemblance to the anticipated motion patterns associated with a dark matter halo, suggesting that dust attenuation could potentially offer an alternate explanation for the customary stellar motion evidence supporting the presence of dark matter halos encircling elliptical galaxies.\nWe employ our findings to explore various aspects of galactic dynamics where we believe dust attenuation must be considered. Specifically, we argue that studying kinematics across different wavelengths can aid in constraining the spatial distribution of dust within elliptical galaxies."}

Titled \"No one can protect you: Bahrain's year of crushing dissent,\" the Amnesty report detailed at least six fatalities, including a child, in the government's crackdown. Bahrain's crackdown on dissent has escalated, resulting in the closure of key political organizations, the removal of citizenship from a Shia spiritual leader, and the incarceration of activists advocating for human rights."}

As a result, the exact determination of the S-matrix for input-output problems is achieved using the Mahaux-Weidenm\\\"uller formula, significantly simplifying the analysis of intricate cavity QED systems. Initially, this methodology is demonstrated by examining the scenario where a photon resonantly interacts with N two-level QEs scattered within an optical cavity. The solution highlights the cumulative impact of QEs, a phenomenon previously observed in specific instances. Can this cumulative effect enhance the inelastic resonant transmission of a single photon? By investigating an optical cavity with two modes resonantly linked to the electronic transitions of N three-level QEs, this question is answered. The analysis indicates that this particular configuration is the most straightforward practical setup capable of down-converting the frequency of a single photon with nearly perfect efficiency under conditions of no external driving force and sufficiently low losses in the cavity and dissipation in QEs. In essence, the straightforward and versatile nature of this novel approach proposes a pragmatic method for identifying and explaining new phenomena in the realm of cavity QED."}

According to this model, pairs are primarily generated near the null charge surface within the gap. The electric field within the gap then separates these pairs, causing them to move in opposite directions. As a result, the region extending from the null charge surface to the light cylinder predominantly witnesses outflow of particles, while the area from the null charge surface to the star experiences inflow of particles. These particles, moving along magnetic field lines, emit curvature photons, which, upon interaction with the strong magnetic field of the star, are converted into pairs that subsequently emit synchrotron photons. It is proposed that the X-ray and soft gamma-ray emissions from PSR B1509-58 arise from the synchrotron radiation of these pairs, with the observation angle of the pulsar favoring inflow radiation. Notably, the creation of magnetic pairs necessitates a significant pitch angle, leading to a distinctive pulse profile of synchrotron radiation compared to curvature radiation. By examining synchrotron radiation pulse profiles with various pitch angles, it is observed that differences in light curves across energy bands stem from the pitch angles of secondary pairs. The emergence of a second peak in the energy range exceeding 10 MeV is attributed to the region close to the star, where the enhanced magnetic field facilitates pair creation at smaller pitch angles."}

Selecting variables when some data points are missing in both the predictors and outcomes is a crucial area of statistical research that has not received as much attention. While existing studies primarily focus on parametric regression methods that directly estimate model parameters, nonparametric machine learning techniques offer more flexibility by not relying on specific assumptions. However, they may lack a straightforward way to measure variable importance compared to parametric models.\n\nOur study explores a general variable selection approach that can handle missing data in both predictors and outcomes, regardless of the pattern of missingness. This approach leverages the flexibility of machine learning models and bootstrap imputation, which align well with nonparametric methods that do not directly estimate covariate effects. Through extensive simulations, we assess how well this variable selection method performs when combined with four tree-based machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forests, BART, and Conditional Random Forests) and two parametric methods (lasso and backward stepwise selection).\n\nOur results indicate that, when using bootstrap imputation, XGBoost and BART exhibit the best overall performance in variable selection, as measured by the $F_1$ score and Type I error, across different scenarios. Interestingly, the choice of imputation method does not significantly impact the variable selection outcomes. We illustrate the effectiveness of these methods with a case study on identifying risk factors for the 3-year incidence of metabolic syndrome using data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation."}

This implies that each prime must divide one of the other factors, and since both the primes and the factors are prime, it follows that they must be equal. Dividing the product by the prime factors reveals a matching counterpart for each prime factor in the other product, demonstrating that the prime factorizations are identical except for their order.

By examining the FIRST radio catalog, a quest is undertaken to identify prominent, continuously emitting sources in neighboring galaxies, possessing radio luminosities exceeding 10% of the luminosity of the persistent source linked to FRB 121102. The selected galaxy sample represents approximately 30% of the total luminosity in the g-band within a range of less than 108 million parsecs, covering an area of 10,600 square degrees. Upon eliminating sources likely attributed to active galactic nuclei or background interference, 11 potential candidates emerge that are presumed to be linked to galactic disks or areas of star formation, though some may be coincidental alignments. Additionally, 85 sources are found within close proximity to galactic nuclei. Assuming that the radio-emitting persistent sources are distinct from galactic nuclei and conform to the luminosity of the galaxy's g-band light, these 11 sources suggest a 95% confidence upper limit on the spatial occurrence of prominent persistent sources, estimated to be less than 5x10^-5 per cubic megaparsec, with only a small fraction of galaxies concurrently hosting radio-luminous persistent sources (less than 10^-3 per galaxy luminosity). If the lifespan of persistent sources is assumed to be around 100 years, the estimated birth rate is less than 5x10^-7 per cubic megaparsec annually. Given the volumetric rate of FRBs, and on the premise that all FRBs repeat and are associated with persistent radio sources, a minimum estimate for the frequency of FRB occurrences per persistent source is greater than 0.8 per year. It is suggested that these 11 identified candidates are promising subjects for FRB investigations, and an estimation of the FRB event rate based on these candidates is provided."}

We propose that the acceleration of the center of mass causes a change in the redshift of the gravitational wave over time, thereby altering its waveform. Our findings indicate that while the cosmological acceleration is too subtle to impact the observable gravitational waveforms through LISA, significant peculiar accelerations could be detectable from sources with longer lifespans. Our analysis centers on black hole binaries of stellar mass, which LISA can detect at lower frequencies and ground-based detectors can catch near coalescence. These binaries may experience notable peculiar accelerations if they originate from environments like nuclear star clusters or AGN accretion disks. If these conditions hold true within an astrophysical population aligned with the observed merger rate by LIGO-Virgo, LISA could potentially measure the peculiar acceleration of a notable fraction of events with an extended mission duration beyond the standard 4 years. Such an extension would enable LISA to investigate the proximity of black hole binary formation to galactic centers, particularly in AGN disks, aiding in distinguishing between various formation mechanisms. While the peculiar acceleration effect may not be quantifiable within a 4-year LISA mission, a portion of events could be influenced by strong peculiar accelerations that, if present, might introduce significant systematic errors to certain waveform parameters. Specifically, the estimation of luminosity distance could be greatly impacted, leading to substantial systematic errors in LISA's measurements of the Hubble constant using stellar mass black hole binaries."}

The influence of various factors such as the plasma fluid's streaming speed, thermal energy, positron density, and positron temperature on the characteristics of large amplitude IASWs is examined through an analysis of the pseudopotential configuration. The study reveals that when the plasma fluid's streaming speed surpasses that of the solitary wave, increasing the fluid's speed results in a deeper and narrower potential well, leading to more compact solitons with higher amplitudes. Conversely, if the plasma fluid's streaming speed is slower than that of the solitary wave, the opposite effect is observed. Furthermore, enhancing the thermal energy leads to broader solitons with reduced amplitudes due to a decrease in the potential well's depth and width. Moreover, augmenting the positron density leads to higher maximum soliton amplitudes and narrower widths. Interestingly, variations in positron temperature do not significantly impact the width and amplitude of IASWs. The study also predicts the presence of stationary soliton-like waves with arbitrary amplitudes in fully relativistic electron-positron-ion (EPI) plasmas, with similar effects observed from factors such as plasma fluid streaming speed, thermal energy, positron density, and positron temperature on these unique solitons as on large amplitude IASWs."}

By conducting simulations of the HI signal post-reionization, which is inherently faint, various noise levels and levels of contamination from foregrounds equivalent to residuals following sky model subtraction were considered. It was determined that employing blind signal separation techniques on image data is necessary to extract the HI signal effectively at large cosmological scales. Among different methods for foreground removal, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) outperformed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), primarily due to GPR utilizing smooth kernels for the overall data covariance. To achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for accurate foreground cleaning, the integration time for a single field should exceed approximately 250 hours.

At lower redshifts (z<1), the 3CRR sample indicates a black hole to spheroid mass ratio of approximately M_bh/M_sph ~0.002, aligning well with the ratio observed locally in inactive galaxies of similar stellar mass (M_sph ~5x10^11 M_sun).

This observed change is inconsistent with the notion that the local black hole to spheroid mass ratio remains constant to a significant extent (98%).

In January, 5-Star's members in the European Parliament attempted unsuccessfully to break away from UKIP, which had effectively campaigned for Britain's exit from the EU.

However, while local and instantaneous\nvariations of neutrino fluxes and heating rates can still be considerably\nhigher with RbR+ transport in 3D, the time-averaged quantities are very similar\nto FMD results because of the absence of a fixed, artificial symmetry axis that\nchannels the flow.

Both methods are based on a two-moment solver with algebraic M1 closure. Results show that there is good agreement between 3D simulations using FMD and RbR+ transport for different grid resolutions in scenarios involving a 20 solar-mass progenitor that does not explode due to simplified neutrino opacities, as well as for a 9 solar-mass model that does explode. This contrasts sharply with axisymmetric (2D) simulations, which indicate that the RbR+ approximation may lead to explosions in 2D, especially in models exhibiting strong axial sloshing of the stalled shock caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI).\n\nAlthough RbR+ transport can result in local and instantaneous fluctuations in neutrino fluxes and heating rates being significantly higher in 3D simulations compared to FMD, the time-averaged quantities are very similar between the two methods due to the absence of a fixed symmetry axis channeling the flow. As a result, apart from random variations, the signals from neutrinos and the post-bounce evolution in 3D simulations using FMD and RbR+ transport are also quite similar, especially when employing higher grid resolutions. The impact of increased spatial resolution is seen to be more significant than the differences arising from the transport methods used. These findings support the suitability of the RbR+ approximation for neutrino transport in 3D supernova modeling."}

It governs how sets of three nucleotide triplets, known as codons, determine the sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis. While most genes use the same standard genetic code, there are variations, such as the code used for protein synthesis in human mitochondria.

In response to this ruling, Morales' adversaries urged voters to spoil their ballots as a form of protest. Morales, who has been in power since 2006, had initially respected the outcome of a 2016 referendum where 51 percent of voters rejected his proposal to lift term limits. Opposition figures viewed the high rate of spoiled ballots as a triumph against Morales' efforts to extend his rule, citing concerns over corruption and judicial manipulation. Morales, on the other hand, contended that the invalid ballots were not a direct protest against him, but rather an opposition strategy to obstruct his vision of a judiciary with elected judges instead of appointed ones. Despite Morales' explanation, critics accused the government of attempting to secure control over the electoral court through the selection of preapproved candidates for the judicial positions. The act of spoiling ballots, achieved through various methods such as marking multiple candidates or defacing the papers, was a notable feature of these elections.

Our research focuses on determining the limitations that these detectors in space could establish regarding the graviton Compton wavelength, denoted as λ_g = h/(m_g c), through the observation of multiple inspiraling black hole pairs. Our findings indicate that while individual inspirals may provide average limitations of around λ_g~3x10^15 km, observing approximately 50 events during a two-year mission could yield a combined limitation around ten times more stringent: λ_g~3x10^16 km (m_g~4x10^-26 eV). The improvement in the limitation progresses faster than the square root of the number of observed events due to a few sources typically offering constraints up to three times better than the average. This outcome is minimally influenced by black hole formation details and detector specifications. In practical terms, the attainable limitation should be roughly one order of magnitude superior to this estimate (and hence nearly comparable to the static, model-dependent limitations from gravitational effects on cosmic scales) as our computations do not factor in the merger/ringdown part of the waveform. The observation that a collection of events can effectively enhance the limitations set by individual binaries on λ_g applies to any theory where deviations from general relativity can be described by a set of overarching parameters."}

Babbage was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1 / 2 ( x ) .\nFor historical reasons , this notation applied to the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions has a specific and diverse interpretation : a positive exponent applied to the function 's abbreviation means that the result is raised to that power , while an exponent of â 1 denotes the inverse function . That is , sin2 x is just a shorthand way to write ( sin x ) 2 without using parentheses , whereas sin â 1 x refers to the inverse function of the sine , also called arcsin x . Each trigonometric and hyperbolic has its own name and abbreviation both for the reciprocal ; for example , 1 / ( sin x )", "predictions": "Explanation:\nIn the given passage, a series of steps is shown that requires only 8 multiplication operations, a significant reduction from the initial estimation of 99 operations. The efficient method described involves exponentiation by squaring or addition-chain exponentiation to compute bn in a complexity of Θ(log n). The challenge of finding the minimal sequence of multiplications for bn is acknowledged, with existing heuristic algorithms available but no known efficient solutions. Additionally, the use of exponential notation for function names is discussed, emphasizing the concept of repeated function composition rather than multiplication. Historical context is provided for the interpretation of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions with positive and negative exponents denoting raising to power and inverse function respectively."}

Similarly, the multiplication operation is commutative as well, except in some cases, such as with matrices and quaternions, where combining a with b might yield a different result compared to combining b with a. Unlike the integers, not all rings exhibit commutativity in multiplication, as the operation may not be invertible. This lack of invertibility means there may not exist an integer a such that 3 multiplied by a equals 1.\nThe integers possess unique properties that are not universal among all commutative rings. For instance, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. While unique factorizations are not always achievable in all rings, Noether introduced the Lasker-Noether theorem for the ideals of many rings as an analog. Noether's contributions involve identifying properties that apply to all rings, creating new versions of old integer theorems, and establishing the minimal assumptions needed to achieve specific properties in rings.\n\n= = = First Era (1908-19) = = =\n\n= = = = Algebraic Invariant Theory = = = =\n\nDuring the initial phase of her career, Noether focused on invariant theory, especially algebraic invariant theory.

In this system, the millisecond pulsar (A) comes very close to the companion pulsar (B) during its orbit projection, with the closest distance (R_{min}=4000 km) being similar to the Einstein radius (2600 km). At this closest approach, gravitational lensing leads to a slight magnification (approximately 10%) of the pulsar A signal over several seconds and a displacement of the pulsar image in the sky plane by around 1200 km. Notably, lensing introduces a correction (of a few microseconds) to the traditional Shapiro delay formula utilized in pulsar timing analysis, causing a geometric time delay in conjunction with the delays associated with the pulsar's spin period. These lensing effects can impact the determination of the system parameters through timing and scintillation studies. Due to the current uncertainty in the orbital inclination, more extreme lensing effects (such as magnification by a significant factor) are feasible.
