{"input":"= Surface diffusion =\n\nSurface diffusion is a general process involving the motion of adatoms , molecules , and atomic clusters ( adparticles ) at solid material surfaces . The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface , as in figure 1 . Just as in bulk diffusion , this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature . Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest @-@ neighbor jumps . Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen has been shown to diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect .\nVarious analytical tools may be used to elucidate surface diffusion mechanisms and rates , the most important of which are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy . While in principle the process can occur on a variety of materials , most experiments are performed on crystalline metal surfaces . Due to experimental constraints most studies of surface diffusion are limited to well below the melting point of the substrate , and much has yet to be discovered regarding how these processes take place at higher temperatures .\nSurface diffusion rates and mechanisms are affected by a variety of factors including the strength of the surface @-@ adparticle bond , orientation of the surface lattice , attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients . It is an important concept in surface phase formation , epitaxial growth , heterogeneous catalysis , and other topics in surface science . As such , the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries . Real @-@ world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters , integrated circuits used in electronic devices , and silver halide salts used in photographic film .\n\n= = Kinetics = =\n\nSurface diffusion kinetics can be thought of in terms of adatoms residing at adsorption sites on a 2D lattice , moving between adjacent ( nearest @-@ neighbor ) adsorption sites by a jumping process . The jump rate is characterized by an attempt frequency and a thermodynamic factor that dictates the probability of an attempt resulting in a successful jump . The attempt frequency Î½ is typically taken to be simply the vibrational frequency of the adatom , while the thermodynamic factor is a Boltzmann factor dependent on temperature and Ediff , the potential energy barrier to diffusion . Equation 1 describes the relationship :\n<formula>\nWhere Î½ and Ediff are as described above , Î is the jump or hopping rate , T is temperature , and kB is the Boltzmann constant . Ediff must be smaller than the energy of desorption for diffusion to occur , otherwise desorption processes would dominate . Importantly , equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature . The manner in which diffusion takes place is dependent on the relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor : when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion . This case , known as mobile diffusion , is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems . For the phenomena described throughout this article , it is assumed that Ediff > > kBT and therefore Î < < Î½ . In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the Î½ and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient , D , versus 1 \/ T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present ( see below ) , there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature .\nRandom walk statistics describe the mean squared displacement of diffusing species in terms of the number of jumps N and the distance per jump a . The number of successful jumps is simply Î multiplied by the time allowed for diffusion , t . In the most basic model only nearest @-@ neighbor jumps are considered and a corresponds to the spacing between nearest @-@ neighbor adsorption sites .

It is important to note that whereas Cohen 's kappa assumes the same two raters have rated a set of items , Fleiss ' kappa specifically allows that although there are a fixed number of raters ( e.g. , three ) , different items may be rated by different individuals ( Fleiss , 1971 , p.378 ) .

This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as Hubble 's law . Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts , in about the year 1912 , while Hubble correlated Slipher 's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law . In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity , redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space : this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us , the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy , so the more the light has been stretched , the more redshifted the light is , and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us . Hubble 's law follows in part from the Copernican principle . Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are , measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements , so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble 's law .\nGravitational interactions of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram . The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe . This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies ( such as the Andromeda Galaxy ) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter , and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution . This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio ( the ratio of a galaxy 's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities ) , an important tool for measuring dark matter .\nThe Hubble law 's linear relationship between distance and redshift assumes that the rate of expansion of the Universe is constant . However , when the Universe was much younger , the expansion rate , and thus the Hubble \" constant \" , was larger than it is today . For more distant galaxies , then , whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times , the approximation of constant expansion rate fails , and the Hubble law becomes a non @-@ linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question . Observations of the redshift @-@ distance relationship can be used , then , to determine the expansion history of the Universe and thus the matter and energy content .\nWhile it was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang , recent observations of the redshift @-@ distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe has begun to accelerate .\n\n= = = Highest redshifts = = =\n\nCurrently , the objects with the highest known redshifts are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts .

Why he was selected for Canterbury is unknown , as there is no contemporary information on his election .\nMost of Ãthelred 's time as archbishop was spent dealing with the effects of Viking raids , but he also had a conflict with King Alfred the Great over royal control of ecclesiastical affairs .

The document that records this agreement is not dated , however , so it is unknown when exactly during Ãthelred 's episcopate the document was drawn up .

{"input":"= Maximum spacing estimation =\n\nIn statistics , maximum spacing estimation ( MSE or MSP ) , or maximum product of spacing estimation ( MPS ) , is a method for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model . The method requires maximization of the geometric mean of spacings in the data , which are the differences between the values of the cumulative distribution function at neighbouring data points .\nThe concept underlying the method is based on the probability integral transform , in that a set of independent random samples derived from any random variable should on average be uniformly distributed with respect to the cumulative distribution function of the random variable . The MPS method chooses the parameter values that make the observed data as uniform as possible , according to a specific quantitative measure of uniformity .\nOne of the most common methods for estimating the parameters of a distribution from data , the method of maximum likelihood ( MLE ) , can break down in various cases , such as involving certain mixtures of continuous distributions . In these cases the method of maximum spacing estimation may be successful .\nApart from its use in pure mathematics and statistics , the trial applications of the method have been reported using data from fields such as hydrology , econometrics , magnetic resonance imaging , and others .\n\n= = History and usage = =\n\nThe MSE method was derived independently by Russel Cheng and Nik Amin at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology , and Bo Ranneby at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences . The authors explained that due to the probability integral transform at the true parameter , the â spacing â between each observation should be uniformly distributed . This would imply that the difference between the values of the cumulative distribution function at consecutive observations should be equal . This is the case that maximizes the geometric mean of such spacings , so solving for the parameters that maximize the geometric mean would achieve the â best â fit as defined this way . Ranneby ( 1984 ) justified the method by demonstrating that it is an estimator of the Kullback â Leibler divergence , similar to maximum likelihood estimation , but with more robust properties for various classes of problems .\nThere are certain distributions , especially those with three or more parameters , whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space . Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down , with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite , rendering the other parameters inconsistent . The method of maximum spacings , however , being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points , does not have this issue , and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions .\nThe distributions that tend to have likelihood issues are often those used to model physical phenomena . Hall & al . ( 2004 ) seek to analyze flood alleviation methods , which requires accurate models of river flood effects . The distributions that better model these effects are all three @-@ parameter models , which suffer from the infinite likelihood issue described above , leading to Hall â s investigation of the maximum spacing procedure .

The SEC has also pressed charges against the management of firms involved in fraudulent earnings management .\n\n= = Motivations and methods = =\n\nEarnings management involves the manipulation of company earnings towards a pre @-@ determined target . This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings , in which case management is said to be carrying out income smoothing .

Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants , and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets .\nEarnings management may involve exploiting opportunities to make accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements . Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting . For example , a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can have a significant effect on net income , and a company using last @-@ in , first @-@ out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods .\n\n= = Detecting earnings management = =\n\nEarnings management may be difficult for individual investors to detect due to the complexity of accounting rules , although accounting researchers have proposed several methods .
