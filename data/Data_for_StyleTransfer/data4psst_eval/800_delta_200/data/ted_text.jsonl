{"src_passage":"With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. \nAnd what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. \nSo there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. \nHeart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. \nIt's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans. \nWe showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. \nAnd in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year. \nNow there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. \nNow these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're kind of devolving.  Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the \ndiet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. \nBut the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. \nSo I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. \nThe salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. \nAnd so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you. \n","predictions":"With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. \nAnd what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us.

{"src_passage":"  Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena. \nI'm 11 years old and from Connecticut. \n Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here. \n I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design? \nWell, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that. \nSo I did a little research on it. \nWell, this is what I found. \nOf course, I hope I can memorize it.  The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. \nBy pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think. \n Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. \n Oh, my gosh! \n OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. \nBut actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. \nIsn't that cool? \n  Design -- I love its design. \nI remember when I was little, my mom asked me, \"Would you like to play the violin or the piano?\" \nI looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- \"I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!\" \n This is small and lightweight. \nI can play from standing, sitting or walking. \nAnd, you know what? \nThe best of all is that if I don't want to practice,  I can hide it. \n The violin is very beautiful. \nSome people relate it as the shape of a lady. \nBut whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated. \nBut I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same -- even from the same maker or based on the same model. \nEntertainment -- I love the entertainment. \nBut actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. \nI mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy. \nSo, it wasn't entertaining at all. \nBut besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk! \n A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz. \nAfter Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: \"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!\" \nAnd Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, \"Funny -- I don't hear anything.\" \n Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. \nNow I know why I'm here. \n  At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more. \nBut ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me. \n Like the multi-dimension stuff. \nI mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school. \n But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that -- well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"  Hi, everyone.

I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died.\" \nAnd Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer. \nAnd my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook. \nIn the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me. \nHe wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life. \nAfter he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore. \nHandwriting is a disappearing art. \nI'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new? \nWhy can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives? \nThere are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug. \nBut too late. \nBut that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.

So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one. \nA value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter. \nIf a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes. \nSo what do I plan to leave for my son? \nI collect autograph books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy. \nI plan to publish my own notebook. \nAs I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote. \nI have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son. \nI'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation. \nAnd those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years. \nI took it out for the first time to come here. \n\"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up. \nI hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me. Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, \nto live again and to love again.\" \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":843,"num_sentence":33}

This is the fifth prototype. It's not quite done. \nWeighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works. \nYou put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment. It's really cheap. \nWe think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars, in low volumes for about 40 dollars. \nAnd we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"This is a work in process, based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine. \n Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration. \nIt's one of those things that stuck in my head. \nIt was a lot like the Stirling engine: it was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it. \nAnd it was invented in 1858, by this guy Ferdinand Carre, but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time. \nThis crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928, and it was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work, but here's how it works. \nThere's two spheres and they're separated in distance. \nOne has a working fluid, water and ammonia, and the other is a condenser. \nYou heat up one side, the hot side. \nThe ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side. \nYou let it cool to room temperature, and then, as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect. \nSo, it was a great idea that didn't work at all: it blew up. \nBecause using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong. \nIt topped 400 psi.

It sprayed everywhere. \nBut it was kind of an interesting thought. \nSo, the great thing about 2006 is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. \nSo, we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics. \nWe proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong. \nWe found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures. \nBrought in a team from the U.K. -- there's a lot of great refrigeration people, it turned out, in the U.K. -- and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could make a low pressure, non-toxic refrigerator. \nSo, this is the way it works. \nYou put it on a cooking fire. \nMost people have cooking fires in the world, whether it's camel dung or wood. \nIt heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour. \nPut it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours. \nIt looks like this. This is the fifth prototype. It's not quite done. \nWeighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works. \nYou put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment. It's really cheap. \nWe think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars, in low volumes for about 40 dollars. \nAnd we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":795,"num_sentence":36}

{"src_passage":"Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air. \nMy doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent, and it was killing me. \nWith the help of IIT, TERI, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. \nWe've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building, while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards. \nThe three plants are Areca palm, Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant. \nThe botanical names are in front of you. \nAreca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen. \nWe need four shoulder-high plants per person, and in terms of plant care, we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi, and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities. \nWe had to grow them in vermi manure, which is sterile, or hydroponics, and take them outdoors every three to four months. \nThe second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue, which is again a very common plant, and we call it a bedroom plant, because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night. \nAnd we need six to eight waist-high plants per person. \nThe third plant is money plant, and this is again a very common plant; preferably grows in hydroponics. \nAnd this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals. \nWith these three plants, you can grow all the fresh air you need. \nIn fact, you could be in a bottle with a cap on top, and you would not die at all, and you would not need any fresh air. \nWe have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi, which is a 50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building. \nAnd it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants. \nOur studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours. \nThe government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi. \nAnd the study showed that, compared to other buildings, there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent, respiratory systems by 34 percent, headaches by 24 percent, lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent. \nAnd this study has been published on September 8, 2008, and it's available on the government of India website. \nOur experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants. \nAnd also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air. \nWe are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building, which will have 60,000 indoor plants. \nWhy is this important?

This is the south polar region, with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole. \nAnd seen just recently in late 2008, here is that region again, now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter. \nAnd I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole, consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. \nAnd at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers, or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface, but we weren't really sure. \nHowever, the implications of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry, and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that, in the intervening two years, we have focused more on Enceladus. \nWe've flown the Cassini Spacecraft by this moon now several times, flying closer and deeper into these jets, into the denser regions of these jets, so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements. \nAnd we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported. \nWhile they're not amino acids, we're now finding things like propane and benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde. \nAnd the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water, which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water, but that that liquid water is in contact with rock. \nAnd that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life. \nSo we are very encouraged by these results. \nAnd we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon, under the south pole, an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms. \nWhether or not there are living organisms there, of course, is an entirely different matter. \nAnd that will have to await the arrival, back at Enceladus, of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future, specifically equipped to address that particular question. \nBut in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we can. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft, an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus, seen here. \nThis region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005.

{"src_passage":"This is a world-changing invention. \nThe smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives, worldwide. \nBut smoke alarms don't prevent fires. \nEvery year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured with 350,000 home fires. \nAnd one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. \nWhat if we could prevent electrical fires before they start? \nWell, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. \nSo how does electricity ignite residential fires? \nWell it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring. \nOur invention had to address all of these issues. \nSo what about circuit breakers? \nWell, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879. \nThis is 130-year-old technology, and this is a problem, because over 80 percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. \nHmmm ... \nSo we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. \nAny electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever -- must be able to tell the power outlet, \"Hey, power outlet, I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire.\" \nAnd the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it. \nSo here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder, a data tag, in the appliance plug. \nAnd we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate. \nNow, every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network. \nThe appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug. \nIf too much current is flowing, the intelligent receptacle turns itself off, and prevents another fire from starting. \nWe call this technology EFCI, Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter. \nOkay, two more points. Every year in the USA, roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. \nAn intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off, until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple. \nNow, besides saving lives, perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings. \nThis invention will reduce global energy consumption of every outlet in every home and business. \nNow you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters. \nHotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location, or even a cell phone. \nThere are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone. \nThe potential energy savings is very, very significant. \nSo far we've applied for 414 patent claims. \nOf those, 186 have been granted: 228 are in process. \nAnd I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition, the 2009 CES Innovation Award. \nSo, to conclude, intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives, prevent tens of thousands of injuries, and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year, while significantly reducing global energy consumption. \nIn the spirit of this year's TED Conference, we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention. \nAnd I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"This is a world-changing invention. \nThe smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives, worldwide. \nBut smoke alarms don't prevent fires. \nEvery year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured with 350,000 home fires. \nAnd one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. \nWhat if we could prevent electrical fires before they start? \nWell, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. \nSo how does electricity ignite residential fires? \nWell it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring. \nOur invention had to address all of these issues. \nSo what about circuit breakers? \nWell, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879. \nThis is 130-year-old technology, and this is a problem, because over 80 percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. \nHmmm ... \nSo we considered all of this.

Simple. \nNow, besides saving lives, perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings. \nThis invention will reduce global energy consumption of every outlet in every home and business. \nNow you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters. \nHotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location, or even a cell phone. \nThere are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone. \nThe potential energy savings is very, very significant. \nSo far we've applied for 414 patent claims. \nOf those, 186 have been granted: 228 are in process. \nAnd I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition, the 2009 CES Innovation Award. \nSo, to conclude, intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives, prevent tens of thousands of injuries, and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year, while significantly reducing global energy consumption. \nIn the spirit of this year's TED Conference, we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention. \nAnd I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world. \nThank you. \n","num_tokens":868,"num_sentence":44}

Actually, no, and this is where many of our problems begin. \nBecause we have to figure out what to do with all these animals. \nIn Brazil, they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities, in which most of the cases, the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers. \nIn 2002, these centers received 45,000 animals, of which 37,000 were birds. \nAnd the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked. \nSome lucky ones -- and among them, Brad -- go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. \nAnd in these places they are cared for. \nThey train their flying, they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature, and they are able to socialize with others from the same species. \n But then what? \nThe Brazil Ornithological Society -- so now we're talking only birds -- claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature. \nTherefore, it would be too risky to release these animals, both for the released and for the natural populations. \nThey also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. \nFollowing this argument, they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized. \nHowever, this would mean having killed 26,267 birds, only in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006. \nBut, some researchers, myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative. \nWe think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health, behavior, inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations, then technically responsible releases are possible, both for the well-being of the individual, and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems, because we will be returning genes for these populations -- which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges -- and also we could be returning \npotential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc. \nAll of these were released by us. \nOn the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom. \nOn the middle, this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release. \nAnd on the bottom, my personal favorite, the little male over there, four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. \nSo, this is not new, people have been doing this around the world. \nBut it's still a big issue in Brazil. \nWe believe we have performed responsible releases. \nWe've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks. \nSo, these genes are indeed going back to the populations. \nHowever this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge. \nSo, I say, \"Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue, let's do whatever we can.\" \nI'm devoting my career to that. \nAnd I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach: Talk to your neighbor, teach your children, make sure your pet is from a legal breeder. \nWe need to act, and act now, before these ones are the only ones left. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna, especially birds, and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month, and transported far from their origins, to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. \nIt is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year, a business worth almost two billion dollars. \nThe police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals, intended to supply the pet market, or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses, and this is how we end up, every month, with thousands of seized animals. \nAnd for us to understand what happens with them, we're going to follow Brad. \nIn the eyes of many people, after the animals are seized, they say, \"Yay, justice has been served. \nThe good guys arrived, took the cute, mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers, and everyone lived happily ever after.\" \nBut did they?

we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV\/AIDS. \nThis is the most devastating epidemic of our time. \nWe also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease. \nThere are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics. \nSo what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. \nAnd this has already saved millions of lives, and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nBut there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance. \nThis is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe problem is that, what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem. \nAnd the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV\/AIDS. \nas a high school student in Uganda. \nThis was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nAnd during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV\/AIDS. \nSo this became one of the driving passions of my life, to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems. \nWe all know about the miracle of miniaturization. \nBack in the day, computers used to fill this entire room, and people actually used to work inside the computers. \nBut what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone. \nAnd I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world, in the Third World countries. \nThe good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories. \nSo, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips. \nI was very lucky to come to the US

\n","predictions":"The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden. \nIf we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest, we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV\/AIDS. \nThis is the most devastating epidemic of our time. \nWe also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease. \nThere are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics. \nSo what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. \nAnd this has already saved millions of lives, and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nBut there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance. \nThis is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe problem is that, what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem. \nAnd the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV\/AIDS. \nas a high school student in Uganda. \nThis was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nAnd during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV\/AIDS. \nSo this became one of the driving passions of my life, to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems. \nWe all know about the miracle of miniaturization. \nBack in the day, computers used to fill this entire room, and people actually used to work inside the computers. \nBut what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone. \nAnd I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world, in the Third World countries. \nThe good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories. \nSo, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips. \nI was very lucky to come to the US

I love complexity. \nAnd I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species. \nSo here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. \nAnd this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before. \nAll the grayed-out species disappear. \nSome are actually on the brink of extinction. \nAnd lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them. \nThese effects were all unanticipated, and yet we're discovering they're predictable. \nSo I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems. \nFirst is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. \nFor example, you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem, or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. \nThe next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another, if you focus only on that link, and then you black box the rest, it's actually less predictable than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links -- and from that place, hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. \nAnd we're discovering, with our research, that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees. \nSo the more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers, and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. \nSo let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. \nThis is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. \nIt was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. \nInstantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. \nAnd the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. \nClearly a complex problem, but is it complicated? \nWell, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, \"Great.

This is the cover. \nAs the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. \nOr, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. \nAnd if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up. \nAnd anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. \nAnd if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. \nAnd so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open. \n Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. \nMike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. \nThis photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map. \nZoom into it and see where it was taken. \nAnd throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. \nSo you can open this one. \n AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... \nMM: It starts playing immediately. \nAnd while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing. \nOr we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing. \nBut one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. \nThis one shows the wind potential all around the United States. \nBut instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is. \nWe can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. \nThis is one of my favorites. \nSo this shows ... \n  When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. \nAnd as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out. \nAnd this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad. \nIt also runs on the iPhone. \nAnd so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. \nAnd it works the exact same way. \nYou can pinch into any page. \nOpen it up. \nSo that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's \"Our Choice.\" \nThank you. \n Chris Anderson: That's spectacular. \nDo you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser? \nWhat is the business here? \nIs this something that other people can do? \nMM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. \nSo Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text. \nCA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?

This is the cover. \nAs the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. \nOr, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. \nAnd if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up. \nAnd anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. \nAnd if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. \nAnd so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open. \n Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. \nMike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. \nThis photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map. \nZoom into it and see where it was taken. \nAnd throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. \nSo you can open this one. \n AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... \nMM: It starts playing immediately. \nAnd while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing. \nOr we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing. \nBut one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. \nThis one shows the wind potential all around the United States. \nBut instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is. \nWe can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. \nThis is one of my favorites. \nSo this shows ... \n  When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. \nAnd as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out. \nAnd this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad. \nIt also runs on the iPhone. \nAnd so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. \nAnd it works the exact same way. \nYou can pinch into any page. \nOpen it up. \nSo that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's \"Our Choice.\" \nThank you. \n Chris Anderson: That's spectacular. \nDo you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser? \nWhat is the business here? \nIs this something that other people can do? \nMM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. \nSo Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text. \nCA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?

\nWell if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. \nSo how are we doing this in the lab?

\nWell, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine. \nAnd this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. \nBut to take baby steps to get there, first of all we want to look at drug design and production, or drug discovery and manufacturing. \nBecause if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere. \nYou don't need to go to the chemist anymore. \nWe can print drugs at point of need. \nWe can download new diagnostics. \nSay a new super bug has emerged. \nYou put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat. \nSo this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly. \nBut perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells, with your genes and your environment, and you print your own personal medicine. \nAnd if that doesn't seem fanciful enough, where do you think we're going to go?

\nWell, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine. \nAnd this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. \nBut to take baby steps to get there, first of all we want to look at drug design and production, or drug discovery and manufacturing. \nBecause if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere. \nYou don't need to go to the chemist anymore. \nWe can print drugs at point of need. \nWe can download new diagnostics. \nSay a new super bug has emerged. \nYou put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat. \nSo this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly. \nBut perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells, with your genes and your environment, and you print your own personal medicine. \nAnd if that doesn't seem fanciful enough, where do you think we're going to go? \nWell, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. \nBeam me up, Scotty. \n","num_tokens":646,"num_sentence":27}

They think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day. \nBut if you come about it from a different perspective, you can create some more interesting, more novel concepts. \nSo we built something. \nI've got some of the pieces in my pocket here. \nSo this is the motor. \nThis motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour, about 30 kilometers an hour, and this battery, this battery right here has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers, which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the U.S. alone. \nBut the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store. \nThese are from remote control airplanes. \nAnd the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently, you can really change things. \nSo today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this. \nPay attention to not only how fun this thing is, but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco. \n [6 Mile Range] [Top Speed Near 20mph] [Uphill Climbing] [Regenerative Braking]   So we're going to show you what this thing can do. \nIt's really maneuverable.

{"src_passage":"These are simple objects: clocks, keys, combs, glasses. \nThey are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey. \nWe are all familiar with these mundane, everyday objects. \nThe fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them. \nUsually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war. \nThese items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland, and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves, 20 years after the war. \nAnd it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered. \nDuring the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations. \nMost of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities, when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army. \nThe international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide. \nGenocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political, religious or ethnic group. \nAs much as genocide is about killing. \nIt is also about destroying their property, their cultural heritage, and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed. \nGenocide is not only about the killing; it is about the denied identity. \nThere are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime. \nThere are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them. \nThese items are recovered from numerous mass graves, and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings, the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust. \nNot a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified. \nOnce recovered, these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned, analyzed, catalogued and stored. \nThousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI. \nThese objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims, but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials. \nSurvivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically, but physical browsing is extremely difficult, an ineffective and painful process. \nOnce the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects, they become orphans of the narrative. \nMany of them get destroyed, believe it or not, or they get simply shelved, out of sight and out of mind. \nI decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse. \nAs a storyteller, I like to give back to the community. \nI like to move beyond raising awareness. \nAnd in this case, someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened. \nPhotography is about empathy, and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy. \nIn this case, I am merely a tool, a forensic, if you like, and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document. \nOnce all the missing persons are identified, only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain. \nIn all their simplicity, these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims, the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed. \nThank you very much. \n","predictions":"These are simple objects: clocks, keys, combs, glasses. \nThey are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey. \nWe are all familiar with these mundane, everyday objects. \nThe fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them. \nUsually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war. \nThese items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland, and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves, 20 years after the war. \nAnd it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered. \nDuring the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations. \nMost of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities, when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army. \nThe international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide. \nGenocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political, religious or ethnic group. \nAs much as genocide is about killing. \nIt is also about destroying their property, their cultural heritage, and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed. \nGenocide is not only about the killing;

{"src_passage":"You may not realize this, but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy. \nThis fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health, and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers. \nNow, the diagram that you see here, I know it looks like some kind of sports play, but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed. \nAnd like writing software, we can print and write DNA into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria. \nWhat this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize, as you're seeing in this movie. \nThe growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair. \nNow, what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules, and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off. \nAnd the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale, but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast, in larger colonies of bacteria, this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other, and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen. \nNow, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing, in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density. \nYou can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie, where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density. \nOur genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards. \nThis particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova, because it looks like an exploding star. \nNow, besides programming these beautiful patterns, I wondered, what else can we get these bacteria to do? \nAnd I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer. \nOne of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors. \nThis happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access, and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive. \nWe started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit, and found that when orally delivered to mice, these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors. \nWe realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics, and hence, the presence of the tumors, was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine, and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer. \nWe went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer, one that is challenging to detect otherwise. \nNow, since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors, we've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors, and we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies. \nAltogether, imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer, or even other diseases. \nOur ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research, and to share this vision, I worked with artist Vik Muniz to create the symbol of the universe, made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells. \nUltimately, my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research. \nThank you. \n","predictions":"You may not realize this, but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy. \nThis fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health, and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers. \nNow, the diagram that you see here, I know it looks like some kind of sports play, but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed. \nAnd like writing software, we can print and write DNA into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria. \nWhat this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize, as you're seeing in this movie. \nThe growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair. \nNow, what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules, and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off. \nAnd the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale, but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast, in larger colonies of bacteria, this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other, and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen. \nNow, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing, in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density. \nYou can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie, where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density. \nOur genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards. \nThis particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova, because it looks like an exploding star. \nNow, besides programming these beautiful patterns, I wondered, what else can we get these bacteria to do?

New York, New York! \nEverybody like, \"Yeah!\" \nWell, we from St. Louis. \n NP: Now you can put y'all hands down. \n EC: But beatbox started here in New York. \nWhat you would have is that, when we would go to parties, you would have the DJ and you would have the rapper. \nBut because I don't have electricity coming out of me, we had to emulate what the beats was doing. \nSo when you would see the beatboxer, you would see us over to the side. \nThen you would see a rapper, and when the rapper began to rap, we would do a simple beat, because back then the beats were simple --  or --  Those were simple beats. \nBut now, you got folks that want to do all type of stuff with their beats now, and they want to humiliate their father, which is not right when you want to humiliate the person that take care of you, pay all your tuition,  especially when you have 50 million people that just go around and call you \"the loser.\" \nWell, I'm taking that to heart. \nBut now we do something different in our house, so we have these jam sessions, and our jam sessions consist of us jamming in church. \nYou know, in church, we'll look at each other like,   and we'll text the beat to each other. \nOr we'll be in the kitchen cooking, road trips, airports. \nNP: Standing right there in the corner, \"Aw, Dad -- listen to that.\" \n Naw, I'm kidding. But you know what? \nWe're talking all about this jam session and everything. \nEC: Yeah. \nNP: Why don't we give them a little peek, just a tiny bit of our jam session? \nNP: Y'all want to hear some jam session? EC: Y'all ready for a jam session? \n NP: Sorry? I can't hear you. \n Yeah! Kick it, pops! \n     NP: I'm getting ready to go! \nEC: Y'all ready? Everybody stand up!
