Upon crossing into Mercer County near Township Road 7 (Darke-Mercer County Line Road), the highway continues its northward journey through rural landscapes. It later encounters Indian Trail Road before approaching the village of Maria Stein in Marion Township. Passing by Marion Local High School, the route intersects with SR 119 in Maria Stein.

However, in 1973, the highway was shortened at its northern extremity to conclude at SR 274 in Chickasaw. The former portion from Chickasaw to Marion Township was redesignated as SR 274, while the section from Marion Township to Franklin Township was removed from the state highway network.\n\n= Key Intersections ="}

Our study relies on the initial data release of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), which offers numerous narrow-band measurements over approximately 1000 square degrees, reaching a limiting magnitude of r~22. This comprehensive analysis of high-redshift Lyman-alpha emitting sources over such an expansive area is groundbreaking, leading to the identification of around 14,500 hyper-bright (L_Lya>10^43.3 erg/s) Lyman-alpha emitting candidates. To verify our selection, we conducted spectroscopic follow-up observations at the GTC telescope, confirming roughly 89% of the identified targets as line-emitting sources, with about 64% being authentic z~2.2 QSOs.\n\nBy extending the Lyman-alpha LF from 2.2<z<3.3 above L_Lya~10^44 erg/s and down to densities of around 10^-8 Mpc^-3, our findings reveal intricate details regarding the Schechter exponential-decay of the brightest end of the Lyman-alpha LF. This complements the power-law segment of previous LF analyses within the 43.3<Log_10(L_Lya / [erg/s])<44 range. The average measurements over the explored redshifts yield Phi^*=(3.33+-0.19)x10^-6, Log(L^*)=44.65+-0.65, and alpha=-1.35+-0.84, showing significant deviations from the typical Schechter parameters found in high-redshift star-forming Lyman-alpha emitters. This indicates that z>2 AGN/QSOs, likely predominant in our samples, exhibit a structurally distinct LF compared to z>2 star-forming LAEs, with L^*_QSOs being approximately 100 times L^*_LAEs and Phi^*_QSOs around 10^-3 times Phi^*_LAEs.\n\nOur methodology effectively identifies high-redshift line-emitting sources without prior spectroscopic confirmation, often misclassified as stars (averaging around 2000 objects in each redshift bin). Assuming a prevalence of Lyman-alpha emitting AGN/QSOs in our dataset, this underscores the notion that these entities represent the most common category of z>2 Lyman-alpha emitters at L_Lya>10^43.3 erg/s."}

Russia denies accusations it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters.  People are still dying every day from that violence,  Tillerson said.  Tillerson, who in 2013 as head of Exxon Mobil was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin, a Russian state honor, said he hoped to agree to deploy U.N. troops to eastern Ukraine, an idea the Russian president floated in September. With an internationally-agreed ceasefire long broken and efforts to revive a 2015 peace deal stalled, peacekeepers could end hostilities and allow trade to resume between Russia and Ukraine. But Tillerson warned there was still a  significant difference between the mandate that a peacekeeping force would be given and the scope of their mandate .

{"src_passage": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel moved this week to bolster his sagging political fortunes, delivering within a few hours both a labor pact with the city’s teachers and a no-drama 2017 city budget devoid of any big tax hikes. On Tuesday morning, Emanuel unveiled a $9.8 billion city spending plan for fiscal 2017 that includes $3.7 billion for operations, relying on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies and a few one-time measures. Since winning re-election last year, the Democratic mayor has been dealing with racially charged fallout from the 2014 police shooting of a black teenager and the pension-driven financial hardships facing the city and its school system. “It is a budget free of an immediate pension crisis, free of the black cloud of insolvency threatening the retirements of city employees and the financial future of Chicago,” Emanuel told the city council.

Emanuel’s administration kept a police video of the killing under wraps while he ran for re-election last year. More broadly, street violence in Chicago continues unabated, leaving the city with more murders this year than New York City and Los Angeles combined. The city budget Emanuel outlined accommodates the initial phase of a two-year plan to add 970 police positions to address the city’s sharp spike in violence. “Until we see the focus on crime in the city and the policing issue from the mayor in more ways than we saw this summer, which was not a lot of focus until it was absolutely necessary, that’s one of the biggest issues in the city,” said Alderman Scott Waguespack, an Emanuel critic and member of the city council’s progressive bloc. Financially, the city has faced a series of credit rating downgrades due to an unfunded pension liability that Moody’s Investors Service has said is the highest among U.S. municipalities it rates.

On Tuesday morning, Emanuel unveiled a $9.8 billion city spending plan for fiscal 2017 that includes $3.7 billion for operations, relying on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies and a few one-time measures. Since winning re-election last year, the Democratic mayor has been dealing with racially charged fallout from the 2014 police shooting of a black teenager and the pension-driven financial hardships facing the city and its school system. “It is a budget free of an immediate pension crisis, free of the black cloud of insolvency threatening the retirements of city employees and the financial future of Chicago,” Emanuel told the city council. Twelve hours earlier, he signed off on a four-year tentative contract deal with teachers in the country’s third-largest public school system to avert what would have been a third strike in four years.

He managed to secure both a labor agreement with the city’s teachers and a 2017 city budget that avoids major tax increases. The $9.8 billion spending plan unveiled on Tuesday includes $3.7 billion for operations, funded by revenue growth, savings, and some one-time measures. Since his re-election, the mayor has been grappling with fallout from a 2014 police shooting and financial challenges due to pension issues. Emanuel highlighted that the budget addresses pension concerns and financial stability, removing uncertainties for city workers and Chicago's future. He also reached a tentative contract deal with teachers to prevent a potential strike, relying on additional revenue from development districts. Despite these positive developments, the mayor still faces political difficulties, including criticism over his handling of the Laquan McDonald case and ongoing street violence. The budget proposal includes funding for increased police positions to tackle rising crime rates. Chicago has experienced credit rating downgrades due to pension liabilities, leading to measures like property tax hikes and new water taxes. Despite some criticism, Emanuel's budget received initial approval from a government finance watchdog group. City council members acknowledge progress in addressing fiscal challenges and social issues but stop short of declaring it a basis for a potential third term in 2019. They emphasize the unpredictable nature of future crises and public opinion."}

They reached Putney Bridge 1 minute and 45 seconds ahead and ultimately won by a remarkable 35-length margin, solidifying their 2-1 lead in the overall event history."}

Firstly, we conduct a detailed analysis on the likelihood of $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ containing a perfect matching and a Hamilton cycle, specifically when $P_n = \\omega\\big(n (\\ln n)^5\\big)$ (with all asymptotic notions considered as $n \\to \\infty).

Following Kurdish moves towards independence, Abadi swiftly responded by reclaiming Kurdish-held territories. In the face of U.S. pressure to remove Iranian-backed fighters, Abadi defended the militias as loyal patriots, rejecting external interference in Iraq's affairs. Seeking backing for his stance on the Kurds, Abadi has sought support from Turkey and Iran.

Although accounting research may not always effectively document earnings management, instances have led to legal actions. The SEC has condemned earnings management for distorting financial reporting and obscuring the true impact of management decisions.

This technique involves maximizing the geometric mean of spacings in the dataset, which are essentially the differences between the values of the cumulative distribution function at adjacent data points.\n\nThe fundamental idea behind this approach is rooted in the probability integral transform. According to this concept, a set of independent random samples obtained from any random variable should exhibit a uniform distribution in relation to the cumulative distribution function of the random variable. By focusing on maximizing the geometric mean of spacings, the MPS method identifies parameter values that promote the uniformity of observed data based on a specific measure of uniformity.\n\nWhile the commonly used method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) may encounter limitations in certain scenarios, such as when dealing with mixtures of continuous distributions, the maximum spacing estimation method can prove to be effective in such cases.\n\nBeyond its applications in mathematics and statistics, this method has been explored in various fields such as hydrology, econometrics, and magnetic resonance imaging, among others.\n\n= = Historical Background and Application = =\n\nThe MSE method was independently developed by Russel Cheng and Nik Amin at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, as well as by Bo Ranneby at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. They emphasized that under the probability integral transform at the true parameter, the spacing between each observation should follow a uniform distribution. This implies that the differences in the cumulative distribution function values at consecutive observations should be consistent. By maximizing the geometric mean of these spacings, the method aims to achieve the best fit. Ranneby (1984) demonstrated that the method serves as an estimator of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, offering robust properties for various problem classes compared to maximum likelihood estimation.\n\nCertain distributions, particularly those with three or more parameters, may encounter challenges with likelihood estimation, especially when likelihoods become infinite along specific paths in the parameter space. In such cases, the maximum likelihood method may fail, while maximum spacing estimation remains reliable by focusing on differences in the cumulative distribution function values. This method provides valid results across a broader range of distributions.\n\nDistributions that commonly face likelihood issues are often employed in modeling physical phenomena. For instance, Hall et al. (2004) studied flood alleviation methods, requiring accurate models of river flood effects. These models, typically three-parameter distributions, face the likelihood issue mentioned earlier. This led to investigations into the maximum spacing procedure.

However, he will give Congress a six-month window to develop new legislation to replace it, according to sources who are knowledgeable about the matter. The President has opted to postpone the enforcement of his decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), as disclosed by two sources on Sunday. One source mentioned that there is a possibility of the President reversing his decision. The move to grant Congress half a year to come up with an alternative, which was initially reported by Politico, serves as a compromise following appeals from prominent Republicans and business leaders urging Trump to retain the program. DACA, established during the Obama administration, shields nearly 800,000 young individuals, often referred to as \"Dreamers,\" from deportation and allows them to work legally. Dreamers represent only a portion of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., predominantly of Hispanic descent. During his campaign, Trump promised to deport all undocumented immigrants, but there has been a widespread show of support for young adults who have spent significant portions of their lives in the United States. The decision, set to be announced on Tuesday, aims to appease both sides of the immigration debate, amidst the President's concurrent focus on issues like North Korea's nuclear program and Houston's recovery from Hurricane Harvey. Despite his campaign vow to immediately dismantle the program, Trump faced strong opposition. House Speaker Paul Ryan advised against rescinding the program, supported by Senator Orrin Hatch, both Republicans. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida expressed disappointment with the decision, stating, “After teasing #Dreamers for months with talk of his ‘great heart,’ @POTUS slams door on them.

Apple CEO Tim Cook also expressed solidarity with Dreamers. Despite concerns raised about the economic consequences, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin played down these warnings, stating he was \"less concerned about the economic impact.\" Most Dreamers hail from Mexico and other parts of Latin America, with sizable populations in states like California, Texas, New York, Illinois, and Florida. Efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform have faced challenges in Congress under different administrations. The fate of the Dreamers has been a subject of active discussion within the White House and the Trump administration, with conflicting perspectives causing internal debate. Proponents of DACA argue that the protected individuals have been raised and educated in the U.S., integrated into American society, with minimal ties to their countries of citizenship. Opponents of the program contend that undocumented immigrants compete with U.S. citizens for job opportunities."}

This is a result of the fundamental theorem of calculus and the fact that the derivative of ln (x) is 1/x. The right side of this equation can be used as a definition of the natural logarithm. The logarithm formulas for products and powers can be derived from this definition. For instance, the product formula ln(tu) = ln(t) + ln(u) is derived as follows:\n<formula>\nThe equation (1) divides the integral into two parts, while equation (2) involves a variable change (w = x/t). In the diagram below, this division corresponds to separating the area into yellow and blue sections. By vertically stretching the left-hand blue area by a factor of t and compressing it horizontally by the same factor, the area's size remains unchanged. By adjusting its position appropriately, the area aligns with the graph of the function f(x) = 1/x once more. Consequently, the left-hand blue area, which represents the integral of f(x) from t to tu, equals the integral from 1 to u. This validates equation (2) with a more geometric explanation.\nThe power formula ln(tr) = r ln(t) can be similarly derived:\n<formula>\nThe second equation involves a change of variables (integration by substitution), w = x^(1/r).\nThe sum of the reciprocals of natural numbers,\n<formula>\nis known as the harmonic series. It is closely linked to the natural logarithm: as n approaches infinity, the difference,\n<formula>\nconverges (i.e., gets very close) to a number known as the Euler–Mascheroni constant. This connection assists in evaluating the efficiency of algorithms such as quicksort.\nThere is another integral representation of the logarithm that proves beneficial in certain scenarios.\n<formula>\nThis can be confirmed by demonstrating that it yields the same value at x = 1 and has the same derivative.\n\n= = = Transcendence of the logarithm = = =\n\nNumbers that are not algebraic real numbers are considered transcendental; for example, π and e are transcendental numbers, while <formula> is not. Almost all real numbers fall into the transcendental category. The logarithm is an illustration of a transcendental function. The Gelfond–Schneider theorem suggests that logarithms typically assume transcendental, i.e., \"complex\" values.\n\n= = Calculation = =\n\nLogarithms are straightforward to compute in certain instances, like log10(1000) = 3. In general, logarithms can be computed using power series or the arithmetic–geometric mean, or they can be obtained from a precomputed logarithm table with fixed precision. Newton's method, an iterative approach for approximating solutions to equations, can also be utilized for logarithm computation, as the inverse function, the exponential function, can be efficiently calculated. If only addition and bit shifts are possible, CORDIC-like methods employing look-up tables can be used to compute logarithms. Additionally, the binary logarithm algorithm computes lb(x) recursively based on iterated squaring of x, making use of the relation\n<formula>\n\n= = = Power series = = =\n\nTaylor series\nFor any real number z satisfying 0 < z < 2, the following formula is valid:\n<formula>\nThis indicates that ln(z) can be progressively approximated with increasing accuracy using the subsequent expressions:\n<formula>\nFor instance, with z"}

Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, is accused of running down a police officer with his car in Edmonton, Alberta, and then stabbing him repeatedly. He then ran down four pedestrians during an attempt to evade capture. Sharif faces 11 charges including five for attempted murder linked to the rampage in the western Canadian city on Saturday night and police said more charges could be laid. He came to Canada in 2012 and was granted refugee status in the same year, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said.  Though targeted in a probe two years ago for promoting extremist ideology, Sharif was deemed to pose no threat after what the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) described on Sunday as an  exhaustive investigation.      Goodale said it would be wrong to blame the attack on any shortcomings in Canada s immigration and refugee vetting system.  There s absolutely no evidence of that whatsoever. The investigation is ongoing, but that conclusion is just not supported by the facts,  Goodale told reporters in Ottawa.  Still, the attack could leave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau open to more criticism from conservatives for the welcoming message he extended to refugees earlier this year, after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries. Canada has seen a surge in illegal border crossings this year as people fearing a U.S. immigration crackdown and possible deportation sought asylum.

We will continue to assure that we meet all of our missions here in the Asia Pacific area. It could be something coming forward from Third Fleet or something like that to meet those requirements,  Chief of U.S. Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said at a briefing aboard the USS Ronald Reagan carrier in Japan. He declined to say when or how many ships could be transferred. The growing threat posed by North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapon advances coupled with operations to counter China s increasing military might in the South China Sea and other parts of Asia is putting an increased burden on the U.S. Seventh Fleet.  That added pressure on crews has been blamed for contributing to a series of accidents involving naval vessels this year including collisions by two destroyers with merchant ships that killed 17 U.S. sailors. In August the USS John S.McCain guided missile destroyer was struck by a merchant ship near Singapore, while its sister ship, the Fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of Japan in June after colliding with a Philippine container ship.  Richardson spoke after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a new national security strategy based on his  America First  vision that singled out China and Russia as  revisionist powers.

The latest ballistic missile tested on Nov. 29 reached an altitude of more than 4,000 kilometers (2485.48 miles), giving it enough-range, Pyongyang claims, to hit major U.S. cities including Washington D.C.  Richardson said his task in 2018 is to build a navy  more lethal  and  dangerous  to potential U.S. foes.   There is a near unanimous consensus that we need more naval power than we have now,  he said. ", "predictions": "YOKOSUKA (Reuters) - The top U.S. Navy official mentioned on Tuesday the possibility of deploying ships from the eastern Pacific to bolster American naval strength in the Asia region. This move comes in response to growing threats and accidents that have weakened the U.S. maritime force. Admiral John Richardson, Chief of U.S. Naval Operations, stated during a briefing on the USS Ronald Reagan in Japan that efforts will be made to fulfill all missions in the Asia Pacific area. He suggested that vessels from the Third Fleet could be redirected to meet the increasing demands, without specifying the timeline or number of ships to be transferred. The escalating challenges posed by North Korea's advancements in ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, along with China's military expansion in the South China Sea and other Asian regions, are straining the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Crews in the fleet are under added pressure, which has been linked to a series of accidents involving naval vessels this year, including fatal collisions. President Donald Trump's recent national security strategy, emphasizing an \"America First\" approach, highlighted China and Russia as \"revisionist powers.\" A U.S. official pointed out China's aggressive actions in the South China Sea, where Beijing is constructing military installations on artificial islands in disputed waters. Richardson underscored the importance of maintaining a presence in the area in response to China's activities. The immediate focus for the U.S. Navy in Asia is the growing threat from North Korea, particularly due to its advancing missile capabilities. Richardson aims to enhance the Navy's readiness against potential adversaries in 2018, acknowledging the widespread agreement on the need for increased naval power."}

One of Trump’s five children, Ivanka was chosen to introduce her father, who then officially accepted the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. Since Trump announced his intention to run for the White House last year, she has been steadily drawn into her father’s presidential campaign along with her 35-year-old husband Jared Kushner.

Historically, Llanllibio was categorized as a tir cyfrif township, a landholding system where the inhabitants, usually a small number of bondmen, labored for the local lord in exchange for limited farming plots and grazing rights. It was the solitary township following the tir cyfrif system in Anglesey to have its own church. Similar to many other settlements in Anglesey and medieval Wales, Llanllibio's population dwindled significantly over time due to various factors such as the impact of the Black Death, conflicts like the Owen Glyndwr revolt, changes in land ownership, and evolving farming techniques that reduced the necessity for bound labor.\n\nLocated on the historic route between London and Holyhead, an Anglesey port town, St Llibio's Church was approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from Bodedern.

The church derived its name from St Llibio, with \"llan,\" originally signifying \"enclosure\" and later representing \"church.\" St Llibio's functioned as a chapel affiliated with the Church of St Afran, St Ieuan, and St Sannan in Llantrisant, about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) away.\n\n= = Closure = =\n\nBy the 17th century, St Llibio's Church had ceased its operations, and worshippers from Llanllibio transitioned to the expanded church in Llantrisant.

Initially conceived to aid in stratigraphy and environmental interpretation, these fossils lack distinctive features for confident classification beyond a kingdom level. The organisms are characterized by tubular structures around 10 μm in diameter with a textured, granular surface. Comparisons were drawn with late Silurian fossils found in the Ludlow epoch and later discoveries on the Scottish island of Kerrera by Charles Wellman. However, similar unornamented filaments discovered in the USA have now been reassigned to Tortotubus.\n\n= = O. granulatum = =\n\nThe primary species under the genus Ornatifilum consists of flattened filaments, possibly distorted due to post-burial pressures. These filaments typically branch at obtuse angles, with irregularly sized grana decorating their surfaces, especially at branching points. Occasionally observed as individual filaments, they can also form clusters termed \"wefts\" by Wellman. Septate in structure, the filaments feature septa resembling pinch points where slight constriction occurs, similar to a twisted balloon. Despite lacking perforations visible in the septa (typically found in red algae and fungi), the presence of such perforations cannot be ruled out, as they are challenging to detect. Other distinguishing features for classification purposes are scarce, with surface ornamentation being a common trait observed in liverwort rhizoids and certain fungi. These fossils are predominantly found in near-shore environments but are never abundant.\n\n= = O. lornensis = =\n\nO. lornensis, identified as a junior synonym of Tortotubus protuberans, exhibits a more intricate appearance compared to O. granatum.

Additionally, side branches and flask-shaped protuberances may protrude from the filaments, with larger ornamentation (2.5 μm versus ~1 μm) present in these regions.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Justice Department official who oversaw efforts to prosecute Islamic State sympathizers and pursue cyber criminals is leaving the Obama administration next month, he told Reuters on Tuesday. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, chief of the national security division at the Justice Department, is departing on Oct. 15, less than a month before the U.S. presidential election.     The departure comes as the Obama administration has struggled to develop clear guidelines on how to pursue hacking amid growing threats posed by foreign nation-states and criminal groups. In an interview, Carlin, 43, declined to say where he was headed next. He intends to spend time with his family before starting a new job, likely involved in cyber security, he said. Carlin, who has served in government for more than 15 years, oversaw a range of prominent cases in three and a half years since assuming an acting rank of the Justice Department’s top national security lawyer in March 2013, including the prosecution of one of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers.  He was confirmed full-time to the position in a 99-1 vote by the U.S. Senate in April 2014.  Carlin focused on pursuing cyber criminals during his tenure running the national security division.  His tenure included the unprecedented indictment of five Chinese military hackers in 2014 for alleged hacking into six U.S. companies in order to steal trade secrets, and the indictment of Iranian hackers earlier this year for alleged hacks on U.S. financial institutions and a New York dam. In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Carlin was a “trusted and tireless leader” who “used all the tools at his disposal to enhance our public safety and uphold our national security.” Carlin will be replaced by Mary McCord, principal deputy assistant attorney general, on an acting basis, the Justice Department said. Through a combination of legal cases, diplomatic sanctions and an effort to publicly name and shame hacking adversaries, Carlin sought to tame what he often called the wild west of cyberspace, where international norms for appropriate cyber activity are nascent or nonexistent. “We’ve laid a strong foundation in cyber, but we’ve got to do more, faster, given the state of the threat,” Carlin told Reuters. He said he hoped the next presidential administration could further “institutionalize” consequences from cyber crime. Most recently Carlin announced this month the formation of a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools. Carlin’s appointment in early 2014 coincided with territorial gains by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that propelled the militant group to global notoriety. Since then, the department has prosecuted dozens of people on counts related to Islamic State: more than 100 people have been charged since 2014 in public federal cases.  Under Carlin, the national security division has also ramped up the Justice Department’s efforts to combat what it sees as a rising threat from domestic anti-government extremists.

In an interview, Carlin, 43, declined to say where he was headed next. He intends to spend time with his family before starting a new job, likely involved in cyber security, he said. Carlin, who has served in government for more than 15 years, oversaw a range of prominent cases in three and a half years since assuming an acting rank of the Justice Department’s top national security lawyer in March 2013, including the prosecution of one of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers.  He was confirmed full-time to the position in a 99-1 vote by the U.S. Senate in April 2014.  Carlin focused on pursuing cyber criminals during his tenure running the national security division.  His tenure included the unprecedented indictment of five Chinese military hackers in 2014 for alleged hacking into six U.S. companies in order to steal trade secrets, and the indictment of Iranian hackers earlier this year for alleged hacks on U.S. financial institutions and a New York dam. In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Carlin was a “trusted and tireless leader” who “used all the tools at his disposal to enhance our public safety and uphold our national security.” Carlin will be replaced by Mary McCord, principal deputy assistant attorney general, on an acting basis, the Justice Department said. Through a combination of legal cases, diplomatic sanctions and an effort to publicly name and shame hacking adversaries, Carlin sought to tame what he often called the wild west of cyberspace, where international norms for appropriate cyber activity are nascent or nonexistent. “We’ve laid a strong foundation in cyber, but we’ve got to do more, faster, given the state of the threat,” Carlin told Reuters. He said he hoped the next presidential administration could further “institutionalize” consequences from cyber crime. Most recently Carlin announced this month the formation of a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools. Carlin’s appointment in early 2014 coincided with territorial gains by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that propelled the militant group to global notoriety. Since then, the department has prosecuted dozens of people on counts related to Islamic State: more than 100 people have been charged since 2014 in public federal cases.  Under Carlin, the national security division has also ramped up the Justice Department’s efforts to combat what it sees as a rising threat from domestic anti-government extremists. ", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top official at the U.S. Justice Department responsible for leading the prosecution of Islamic State supporters and tackling cyber criminals is leaving his post in the Obama administration next month, as he informed Reuters on Tuesday. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, who heads the national security division at the Justice Department, will step down on October 15, shortly before the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Carlin's departure coincides with the administration's struggles in developing clear guidelines for dealing with hacking amidst increasing threats from foreign nations and criminal organizations. In an interview, Carlin, aged 43, chose not to disclose his next career move but mentioned plans to spend time with his family before potentially joining a new role in cybersecurity. With over 15 years in government service, Carlin has overseen several high-profile cases since taking on the role of the Justice Department's top national security attorney in March 2013, such as the prosecution of a perpetrator of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. His appointment to the position was officially confirmed in April 2014 through a Senate vote of 99-1. During his tenure, Carlin concentrated on pursuing cyber criminals, leading to significant cases like the indictment of five Chinese military hackers in 2014 for allegedly hacking U.S. companies to steal trade secrets, and the indictment of Iranian hackers earlier this year for alleged breaches on U.S. financial institutions and a dam in New York. In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch praised Carlin as a dedicated and diligent leader who utilized various strategies to enhance public safety and national security. Carlin will be succeeded by Mary McCord, principal deputy assistant attorney general, on an interim basis, according to the Justice Department. Through a combination of legal actions, diplomatic measures, and efforts to publicly expose hacking adversaries, Carlin aimed to regulate the \"wild west\" of cyberspace, where global standards for appropriate cyber activities are still evolving. Expressing a need for swift action given the current threats, Carlin hoped the incoming presidential administration could establish more concrete consequences for cybercrime. In his latest move, Carlin announced the establishment of a threat analysis team to investigate potential national security risks posed by technologies like self-driving cars and Internet-connected devices. Carlin's appointment in early 2014 coincided with the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, leading to a surge in prosecutions related to the group. Since then, over 100 individuals have been charged in public federal cases tied to the Islamic State under Carlin's leadership. Additionally, the national security division has intensified efforts under Carlin to combat the perceived growing threat from domestic anti-government extremists."}

For instance, the femoral stem of such an implant is typically made of either 316L or 316LN stainless steel. Fretting corrosion, which involves friction under slight movements, can occur during human walking due to repeated interactions between the metal of the prosthesis and the bone. Various experimental studies have explored fretting corrosion. The passive layer, only a few nanometers thick at room temperature, is considered crucial for the advancement of civilization by some scholars. This study aims to forecast the thickness of the passive layer on stainless steel subjected to fretting corrosion, with a particular focus on the role of proteins. The model employed is based on the Point Defect Model (at a microscopic level) and an enhancement that considers the friction process under small displacements. A genetic algorithm was utilized to optimize problem resolution. Significant findings show that, consistent with experimental data, albumin, the protein under scrutiny, inhibits degradation of stainless steel at low chloride concentrations; furthermore, at higher chloride levels, an incubation period is necessary to disrupt the passive film."}
{"src_passage": "MARSEILLE, France/PARIS (Reuters) - Two women were stabbed to death and their assailant shot dead by a soldier in the southern French port city of Marseille on Sunday in what officials described as a  likely terrorist act . Police sources said the suspect had shouted  Allahu Akbar  (God is greatest) in Arabic as he attacked the women, aged 17 and 20, at Marseille s main railway station. Two police sources said one had her throat slit while the other was stabbed in the chest and stomach. An Islamic State militant was responsible for the attack, the group s Amaq news agency said. The assailant was shot dead by a soldier from a military Sentinelle patrol, a force deployed across the country as part of a state of emergency declared after Islamist attacks that began almost two years ago.  We have until now managed to avoid such dramatic incidents (in Marseille). I think it was a terrorist attack and the individual who was killed seems to have had several identities,  Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin told reporters. Paris was rocked in 2015 by multiple attacks that killed 130 people. In 2016 a gunman drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86 people. Both of these attacks were claimed by Islamic State. Other countries, including Britain, Germany and Belgium, have also suffered attacks by militants using knives, guns, explosives and driving vehicles at crowds. Some 200 police officers cordoned off the area and all roads were closed to traffic. A witness told Reuters she saw a man take out a knife from his sleeve and then stab a young girl and then a second woman, shouting what could have been  Allahu Akbar . Speaking in Marseille, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the man had initially killed one woman and looked to be running away before returning to attack a second woman and then rush toward soldiers from the Sentinelle force who arrived on the scene quickly and shot him dead. Two police sources said the attacker had been carrying a butcher s knife, was around 30 years old and of North African appearance. One source said he was known to police for common law crimes, while another said digital analysis of fingerprints had come up with several aliases.  This could be an act of terrorism, but we cannot confirm it fully at this stage,  Collomb told reporters. French troops are part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa fighting al Qaeda-linked militants, operations that have made these groups urge their followers to target France. Security forces have increasingly been targeted by militants in knife attacks. A man wielding a knife attacked a soldier in a Paris metro station on Sept. 15. President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter he was  disgusted by this barbaric act  and praised the calmness and efficiency of security forces. French lawmakers are due to vote on a much-criticized anti-terrorism law on Tuesday, which would see France come out of its state-of-emergency in November, although some of the powers would be enshrined into law. The number of military personnel on the ground is also due to be reduced slightly, although the force is being adapted to make it more mobile and its movements less predictable.  The presence of Sentinelle soldiers, their speed and efficiency ensured that the death count was not bigger,  police union official Stephane Battaglia told Reuters.

Despite this, Cambridge emerged victorious by a margin of three-quarters of a length, strengthening their lead in the overall standings to 3-1.\n\nBackground:\nThe Boat Race is a traditional rowing competition pitting the University of Oxford (\"Dark Blues\") against the University of Cambridge (\"Light Blues\"). Inaugurated in 1829, the race unfolds on the River Thames in southwest London. Following consecutive losses in 1836 and 1839, Oxford University Boat Club was founded on April 23, 1839, to enhance crew selection processes. This club was open to university members and governed by college boat club captains. The challenge from Oxford to Cambridge was issued in February, and after deliberation, the race date was set for April 15, 1840, with appointed umpires and a referee. The race spanned a 9.2 km stretch between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge.\n\nCrews:\nThe Oxford crew averaged 11 st 10.5 lb (74.4 kg) per rower, slightly heavier than their Cambridge counterparts. Cambridge featured returning former Blues Alfred Shadwell and cox Thomas Selby Egan, while Oxford's crew included experienced racers Samuel Maberly and R. G. Walls.\n\nRace:\nOxford won the coin toss and chose to start from the Middlesex side, leaving the Surrey side to Cambridge. The race commenced below Westminster Bridge at 1:30 pm, with Edward Searle as the starter. Both teams faced challenges due to steamers obstructing the route, but Oxford initially took the lead. However, rough waters caused by the steamers disrupted the rhythm for both crews. Cambridge started closing the gap near Vauxhall Bridge, and after a steering mishap by Oxford's cox Garnett, Cambridge surged ahead. Despite facing further rough waters near Battersea Bridge, Cambridge maintained their lead and crossed the finish line at Putney Bridge, winning by three-quarters of a length. The race concluded in 29 minutes and 3 seconds, elevating Cambridge's lead in the series to 3-1."}

While the precise construction date remains undocumented, the barn was primarily used to collect tithes for the abbey, typically amounting to one-tenth of a farm's yield. The West Pennard Court Barn, part of the Glaston Twelve Hides jurisdiction, is the most compact of the remaining barns from this era. Following a survey in 1932 that identified roof damage, the structure eventually collapsed in 1935. The restoration efforts in 1936, funded by Roger Clark of C. & J. Clark shoemakers, preserved the original trusses wherever feasible. The barn was officially acquired by the National Trust in 1938 and later designated as a Grade I listed building in 1961.

Each side wall includes ventilation slits, while the end walls have breathers shaped as a cross pommee.

The 2001 Information Quality Act, passed under Republican President George W. Bush, has for years provided a way for companies and their lobbyists to challenge federal agencies’ assumptions on issues ranging from the threats posed by global warming to the health effects of petrochemicals. Now, as Trump’s leadership seeks to get the Environmental Protection Agency into line with the new administration’s more pro-business and anti-regulation agenda, the act could become a tool for rebellious scientists and climate advocates, legal experts said. Trump has expressed doubts about the science behind climate change, putting his administration on a collision course with an overwhelming majority of scientists who believe that human consumption of fossil fuels is warming the planet and triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms. A spokesman for Trump’s EPA said last week that the agency’s website is under review, raising worries of a rewrite that could put the site at odds with EPA employees’ own research. A Trump administration official did not respond to a request for comment. “Posting blatantly false information on the EPA’s website would violate the Information Quality Act,” said Romany Webb, a climate law fellow at Columbia University. “The guidelines clearly state that information disseminated to the public, including via a website, must be substantively accurate.” Michael Halpern, deputy director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit climate science advocacy group, said the Information Quality Act could be one of the options scientists consider using to ensure federal agencies match scientific research. The Information Quality Act allows individuals who object to information presented by a federal agency to request a correction. If the agency denies the request, the individual can appeal in a process overseen by an independent inspector general. In the case of the EPA, the appeal would go to a panel of political appointees – who will likely be named after Trump’s pick to head the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is confirmed.

The 2001 Information Quality Act, enacted during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush, has historically allowed companies and their advocates to challenge government agencies' assumptions on various issues, including global warming and the health impacts of petrochemicals. As Trump's administration aims to align the Environmental Protection Agency with a more business-friendly and deregulatory agenda, legal experts suggest that the act could be wielded by dissenting scientists and climate activists. Trump has cast doubt on the scientific basis of climate change, setting his administration against the prevailing consensus among scientists who attribute global warming and related phenomena to human fossil fuel consumption. Concerns have arisen over potential changes to the EPA's website following a statement by an EPA spokesperson indicating a review is underway. This has raised fears of alterations conflicting with the agency's own research. Referring to this, Romany Webb, a climate law fellow at Columbia University, emphasized that disseminating false information on the EPA site would violate the Information Quality Act's stipulation that public information, including website content, must be factually accurate. Michael Halpern, deputy director at the Center for Science and Democracy, noted that the Information Quality Act could be an avenue for ensuring federal agencies adhere to scientific evidence. The act permits individuals to challenge agency information and seek corrections, with an option for appeal overseen by an independent inspector general. For the EPA, this process could involve political appointees, likely selected under Scott Pruitt, Trump's nominee for EPA head. The existing Inspector General, appointed by Barack Obama, retains discretionary authority to address any significant issues. While the Trump transition team's handling of inspectors general has drawn attention, employees also have avenues, such as reporting to the agency's Scientific Integrity Officer. Previous industry attempts to use the Information Quality Act have shown varied outcomes, with a report indicating limited corrections in response to requests. Halpern is optimistic that scientists could achieve better results by raising concerns through this mechanism rather than industry groups. Halpern also stressed the importance of upholding the EPA's scientific integrity policy, which grants agency scientists final say over information within their expertise. Despite internal safeguards to maintain website accuracy, a former EPA official acknowledged the current uncertainties surrounding the agency's situation."}

This statement seemed to be a shift from President Tayyip Erdogan's warning earlier in the week that halting the flow of trucks and oil across the border could lead to hardship for Iraqi Kurds. Despite the overwhelming support for independence from Iraqi Kurds in the referendum, Turkey, along with other neighboring countries, expressed concerns about potential regional conflicts being reignited. Yildirim emphasized that the measures taken will specifically target those who decided to proceed with the referendum, reassuring that the civilian residents in the region would not bear the consequences.\n\nTurkey has pledged various economic, security, and political actions in response to the referendum, without detailing specific steps so far. Erdogan previously mentioned the possibility of disrupting trade and oil flow, suggesting that Kurds could face difficulties if sanctions were imposed. The flow of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil through Turkey from northern Iraq plays a significant role in connecting the region to global markets, with Iraq being a substantial export destination for Turkey. Despite the ongoing Kurdish insurgency in Turkey's southeast, which has a large Kurdish population, the fear of escalating separatist tensions due to the referendum remains a concern.\n\nIn a recent clash near the Turkey-Iraq border, the Turkish military reportedly killed three PKK militants in northern Iraq, resulting in the death of one Turkish soldier and injuries to four others. This incident occurred during military exercises conducted by Turkish and Iraqi troops in response to the independence referendum. Turkish soldiers have long been stationed in northern Iraq, including at the Kanimasi area, to prevent PKK militants from crossing into Turkey. The PKK, deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the U.S., and the EU, has its leadership based in the mountains of northern Iraq. Although Turkish airstrikes on PKK targets in the region are common, ground clashes like the recent one are relatively rare. The conflict between the Turkish government and the PKK has claimed over 40,000 lives since the insurgent group initiated its separatist activities in 1984."}

As their dynamical\nmass can be measured within a few years, they can be used to calibrate the\nevolutionary tracks and set new constraints on the age of young moving groups.\nWe find a total mass of $\\mathrm{0.18\\pm 0.02~M_\\odot}$ for TWA 22. That mass\nis in good agreement with model predictions at the age of the Beta Pic moving\ngroup. We obtain a total mass of $\\mathrm{1.09 \\pm 0.10~M_{\\odot}}$ for GJ\n2060. We estimate a spectral type of M$1\\pm0.5$,\n$\\mathrm{L/L_{\\odot}=-1.20\\pm0.05}$ dex, and $\\mathrm{T_{eff}=3700\\pm100}$ K\nfor GJ 2060 A. The B component is a M$3\\pm0.5$ dwarf with\n$\\mathrm{L/L_{\\odot}=-1.63\\pm0.05}$ dex and $\\mathrm{T_{eff}=3400\\pm100}$ K.\nThe dynamical mass of GJ 2060 AB is inconsistent with the most recent models\npredictions (BCAH15, PARSEC) for an ABDor age in the range 50-150 Myr. It is 10\nto 20\\% (1-2 sigma, depending on the assumed age) above the models predictions,\ncorresponding to an underestimation of $0.10$ to $0.20~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$.\nCoevality suggests a young age for the system ($\\sim$ 50 Myr) according to most\nevolutionary models. TWA 22 validates the predictions of recent evolutionary\ntracks at $\\sim$20 Myr. On the other hand, we evidence a 1-2 sigma mismatch\nbetween the predicted and observed mass of GJ 2060 AB. This slight departure\nmay indicate that one of the star hosts a tight companion. Alternatively, this\nwould confirm the models tendency to underestimate the mass of young low-mass\nstars.\n", "predictions": "Evolutionary models are commonly utilized to estimate the mass of stars, brown dwarfs, and giant planets. These models are considered to be less accurate for young objects (less than 200 million years old) and in the low-mass range (less than one solar mass). GJ 2060 AB and TWA 22 AB are unusual M-dwarf binary systems belonging to the AB Doradus and Beta Pictoris moving groups. By measuring their dynamical mass in just a few years, these systems can be used to refine evolutionary models and place new limits on the ages of young moving groups.\n\nFor TWA 22, the total mass is determined to be approximately 0.18 solar masses, aligning well with model predictions for the Beta Pictoris moving group's age. GJ 2060 has a total mass of around 1.09 solar masses. The spectral type of GJ 2060 A is estimated to be M1 ± 0.5, with luminosity and effective temperature values provided. The B component is identified as a M3 ± 0.5 dwarf, also with luminosity and effective temperature details.\n\nDespite the agreement between TWA 22 and recent evolutionary models, there is a discrepancy of 10 to 20% between the observed dynamical mass of GJ 2060 AB and the predictions of models like BCAH15 and PARSEC for an ABDor age between 50-150 million years. This divergence suggests a potential underestimation of 0.10 to 0.20 solar masses by the models. The coevality of GJ 2060 AB indicates a young age of around 50 million years according to most evolutionary models. In contrast, TWA 22 confirms the accuracy of recent evolutionary tracks for an age of approximately 20 million years. The observed mismatch in mass for GJ 2060 AB, suggesting the presence of a close companion or an inherent tendency of models to underestimate mass for young, low-mass stars, is notable."}

{"src_passage": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York and California’s Democratic governors said on Friday residents would face hefty tax increases and some would leave their states under a proposal in the Republican tax plan that would eliminate state and local tax (SALT) deductions on federal income tax. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Jerry Brown of California spoke in a joint conference call a day after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that advanced President Donald Trump’s tax plan. Republican leaders have sketched out an outline of the tax measures that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday. If the SALT deduction were eliminated the tax package would  disproportionately hit residents of states that have high income taxes, many of which are historically Democratic, the governors said.  “This is an attack on California, New York and New Jersey, and other states that would not vote for Trump,” Brown said. “It’s a gross manipulation of our tax code.” The SALT deduction allows residents to subtract income taxes paid to states and local governments from the total income taxed by the federal government taxes. Its elimination would be one among a series of measures to offset lost revenues from what are envisaged as sweeping overall cuts on corporate and personal taxes. While analysts say the overall tax package would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, many residents of high-tax states who use the deduction would pay more, the governors said.  In New York, taxpayers would pay an average of an additional $5,300 in federal income taxes a year without the SALT deduction, Cuomo’s office said in a separate statement. That sharp increase in taxes would likely lead to an exodus of residents, starting with high earners, who would see the greatest increases, Cuomo said. “Higher-income people will move,” he said. Some Republican lawmakers from high-tax states voted against the budget measure on Thursday to express opposition to the elimination of the SALT deduction. Republican congressional leaders are working to allay their concerns. “If the SALT is repealed, we would expect some deterioration of credit quality for affected states and localities in the medium term, including some price pressure on housing markets in areas bordering states with lower local taxes (eg, southern New Jersey),” Barclays analysts wrote to clients on Thursday. “However, municipal bonds issued by high tax states and localities would likely become even more valuable to investors, and there could be stronger demand from retail investors, bringing yields and muni-Treasury ratios down,” Barclays said.

The film revolves around a grandfather who loses everything due to gambling, ultimately leading to the tragic demise of his granddaughter, Little Nell. Despite its survival, parts of the film are lost, with modern analyses and research likely shedding more light on its production. The movie received positive reviews upon its release, with critics praising its faithful adaptation and attention to detail despite the limitations of the single reel format. The film's director was Barry O'Neil, and while the scenario writer and cameraman remain uncredited, the movie's surviving status offers opportunities for further exploration of its creation and reception."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will propose beefing up military spending and slashing domestic programs and foreign aid in his fiscal year 2018 budget to be released on Thursday.  Here are the highlights: The budget calls for an increase of $52 billion for the Defense Department above the 2017 base budget of about $522 billion, enacted under the Obama administration. There is an additional $2 billion increase in defense spending in other departments, including Energy and State. That is still less than some of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress have called for, including the heads of the committees in the Senate and House of Representatives that oversee the U.S. military. But at a time of broad cuts elsewhere in the budget, the Pentagon is unlikely to complain.  The plan earmarks the new funds to accelerate the fight against Islamic State militants, reverse Army troop reductions, build more ships for the Navy and ramp up the Air Force – including by purchasing additional F-35 fighter jets, built by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N). The Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump wants Congress to shell out $1.5 billion for his promised border wall with Mexico in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018. The combined budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, would fall by 28 percent, with funding cuts for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs. The plan preserves $3.1 billion in security aid to Israel. The budget also requests $12 billion in so-called Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funding for extraordinary costs, chiefly in war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. No comparison was provided for the current year’s OCO spending. Current commitments on HIV/AIDS treatment under PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, will be maintained. PEPFAR is the world’s largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine and enjoys bipartisan support. The Environmental Protection Agency’s budget would be cut by 31 percent, eliminating its climate change programs and trimming back core initiatives aimed at protecting air and water quality. The proposal would eliminate 3,200 EPA employees, or 19 percent of the current workforce, and effectively erase former Democratic President Barack Obama’s initiatives to combat climate change by cutting funding for the agency’s signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Healthcare companies such as drug makers and device makers will pay more than twice as much in 2018 to have their medical products reviewed for approval by the Food and Drug Administration under the proposed budget. The proposal budgets over $2 billion in fees to be collected from industry, twice as much in 2017. Oversight of air traffic control would move from the federal government to an independent group under the proposals, which include a 13 percent cut for the Department of Transportation’s discretionary budget. The plan also calls for cutting the U.S. space agency NASA budget by 0.8 percent to $19.1 billion.  The budget for the Department of Energy would include $120 million to restart licensing for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump in Nevada, a project that has been stalled for years because of lawsuits and local opposition.

In a Dec. 16 letter to Heritage seen by Reuters, Maryland Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings and Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders said they feared the company was “disingenuous at best” in October 2014 when it told them it had not seen any significant price increases for its doxycycline hyclate product. “We are very concerned that you made these assertions to Congress on behalf of Heritage during the exact time period that its executives were engaged in a price fixing scheme to prevent competition from driving down prices of doxycycline hyclate,” they wrote. In response to Friday’s letter, the company said it does not make the same version of doxycycline hyclate that the lawmakers asked about in 2014. Heritage makes a delayed release version, not the immediate release version that was the subject of the 2014 inquiry. Heritage said it explained this to the lawmakers in its 2014 response. The letter to Heritage comes after criminal and civil charges were filed by the Justice Department and 20 states in connection with an alleged price fixing scheme involving doxycycline hyclate and glyburide, a diabetes drug. On Wednesday, the Justice Department criminally charged Heritage’s former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Glazer and former Heritage Vice President of Commercial Operations Jason Malek, accusing them of colluding with other generic manufacturers in schemes that entailed allocating market share and conspiring to raise prices. The next day, 20 states filed a parallel civil lawsuit against Heritage, along with Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mayne Pharma Group, Citron Pharma and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., saying they colluded to fix prices. The lawsuit characterized Heritage as the “ringleader,” with Glazer and Malek overseeing and running the scheme. Mylan and Teva have previously denied the states’ civil charges. Sanders and Cummings launched a congressional inquiry into rising generic drug prices on Oct. 2, 2014, including the price of doxycycline hyclate.  As part of that, they sent a letter to Glazer while he was still CEO of Heritage to inquire about the prices.

Maryland Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings and Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders have raised concerns in a letter dated Dec. 16, indicating that they believe Heritage may have been less than truthful back in October 2014 when responding to a congressional inquiry regarding a significant price increase in their doxycycline hyclate product. The lawmakers suspect that Heritage might have been deceptive during the period it claimed there were no notable price hikes for the antibiotic while allegedly participating in a price fixing scheme to stifle competition and maintain prices. In their recent communication with Heritage, the company pointed out that they do not manufacture the same immediate release version of doxycycline hyclate that was the focus of the lawmakers' inquiry in 2014. Heritage clarified that they produce a delayed release version and had already explained this distinction in their 2014 response to the lawmakers. This letter to Heritage follows legal actions taken by the Justice Department and 20 states against various generic drug manufacturers, including Heritage, over allegations of price fixing involving doxycycline hyclate and glyburide. Former CEO Jeffrey Glazer and former Vice President Jason Malek were charged criminally by the Justice Department for colluding with other companies to manipulate market shares and inflate prices. Additionally, the states filed a civil lawsuit naming Heritage as the orchestrator of the scheme, with Glazer and Malek reportedly leading the operation. While Mylan and Teva have refuted the civil charges brought by the states, Sanders and Cummings initially launched an inquiry into rising generic drug prices in 2014, specifically addressing the price of doxycycline hyclate by contacting Glazer when he was still with Heritage. The company's outside counsel at the time, Gary Ruckelshaus, responded on their behalf stating that Heritage had not observed any significant price increases for the drug."}

Key words. supernovae: general - stars: evolution - galaxies:\nabundances\n", "predictions": "Context. Certain types of supernovae (SNe) known as circumstellar-interacting (CSI) SNe are the result of massive stars shedding mass just before their explosive demise. Some SNe IIn are believed to have originated from luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. Preceding a SN explosion, there have been instances of outbursts observed in a few CSI SNe, referred to as SN impostors (SN IMs), but it remains uncertain whether these events are indicators of an impending supernova occurrence. The diverse observational characteristics of CSI SNe point to potential alternative progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with strong winds. The influence of metallicity on the mass loss of CSI SN progenitors remains largely unexplored. Goals. Our objective is to enhance our understanding of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by investigating their surroundings, specifically focusing on the metallicity levels in their vicinity. Methods. Metallicity measurements at the sites of 60 transients (including SNe IIn, SNe Ibn, and SN IMs) were obtained through emission-line analysis of optical spectra collected at the Nordic Optical Telescope and from public repositories. Additional metallicity data from existing literature were included in our analysis. We compare the metallicity profiles across various subtypes of CSI SNe and contrast them with those of other core-collapse SN categories. Additionally, we explore potential relationships between metallicity and observational characteristics of CSI SNe. Results. We observe that SN IMs are more likely to occur in regions with lower metallicity compared to SNe IIn. Within the SNe IIn category, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) events exhibit higher metallicities akin to those of SNe IIL/P, whereas longer-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) display lower metallicity levels similar to SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe IIn can be explained by combining the metallicity characteristics of SN IMs (possibly resulting from significant outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe IIP (emitted by RSGs). Similar patterns are observed in the Normalized Cumulative Rank (NCR) values, which gauge the association of SNe with H II regions. For SNe IIn, higher metallicities correspond to increased mass-loss rates and faster CSM velocities. Optical luminosity enhancements during SN IM outbursts tend to be more pronounced at higher metallicities, whereas the optical luminosities of SN IMs during quiescent periods are typically lower. Conclusions. The disparity in metallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs indicates that LBVs are not the sole progenitor source for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe potentially stemming from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. While linedriven winds may not be the primary factor in the late-stage mass loss of CSI SN progenitors, metallicity does impact the observational characteristics of these transitory events.

We have produced detailed images, achieving a resolution as fine as 7\" (~100pc), of the distribution of HI along the dust lane. Our data offer enhanced velocity resolution and sensitivity compared to previous studies. The HI spans a distance of approximately 15kpc. By utilizing a titled-ring model of the disk in conjunction with our data, we are able to confirm that the HI's kinematics demonstrate a typical rotation within a significantly warped structure, extending down to the nuclear level. While our model's parameters, particularly the inclination, vary somewhat from past proposals, they align with recent findings derived from stellar light in a central ring. The model also effectively explains the shape of the dust lane observed with Spitzer. We have not identified any prominent irregularities in the kinematics at a large scale that could be linked to material supply for the AGN. However, there are radial motions at larger radii (r>6kpc), mostly involving unsettled gas forming a tail/arm-like configuration. The relatively stable motion of the gas within this formation indicates it is in the process of integrating into the primary disk, supporting the merger/interaction origin of the HI in Cen A. Our analysis suggests a timespan of 1.6-3.2*10^{8}yr since the merger event based on the structure and kinematics. The HI's kinematics do not necessitate a bar structure for explanation. Comparing the timescale derived from the large-scale HI structure with that of the radio structure, alongside the consistent movement of the HI down to sub-kpc regions, does not imply a direct link between the merger and the phase of radio activity. Notably, the radial movements in the outer regions result in redshifted projected velocities, contrasting with regular orbits. This finding invalidates the possibility of blueshifted absorption, previously discussed, being caused by outward-moving gas projected onto the center from large radius. Hence, the interpretation of the blueshifted absorption, in addition to some of the redshifted nuclear absorption, as evidence of a standard inner disk, remains valid. Lastly, we highlight the identification of two unresolved clouds situated at distances of 5.2 and 11kpc (in projection) from the HI disk. These clouds likely represent remnants of the merger event that introduced the HI gas."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is ramping up his search for a new chief for the U.S. central bank, meeting with former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and three others and promising a decision next month. “I’ve had four meetings for Fed chairman and I’ll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Trump has previously suggested he may reappoint Fed Chair Janet Yellen to the post. Jerome Powell, one of the current governors on the Fed’s board, also met with Trump earlier this week about the Fed job, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Trump on Friday did not provide details on his meetings.  A new Fed chair would take the helm as the central bank eases well away from crisis-era policies in response to a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, though inflation still lingers below the Fed’s 2-percent goal. Under Yellen, the Fed has raised interest rates and launched a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Much of the latter was accumulated through a controversial bond-buying program that Yellen said helped the economy avert an even deeper downturn. Her term as chair expires in February.  Warsh was a Fed governor between 2006 and 2011 and resigned from the board because of his opposition to the bond-buying program. He has called for a revamp of how the Fed makes monetary policy, saying it needs “fresh air” from markets and from the “real economy.”  Treasury yields spurted higher on news of the Trump meetings; Warsh is viewed as more of a hawk than Yellen. “He’s definitely more hawkish on the spectrum. He is quite a contrast to Yellen. It does seem he is the front-runner even though it’s not a sure thing he will be nominated,” Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said of Warsh. As recently as July, Trump had not ruled out reappointing Yellen, telling the Wall Street Journal that he liked her demeanor and desire to keep interest rates low. In addition to Warsh and Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor’s name also has been floated as a contender. Powell specialized in financial regulatory matters during his five years on the Fed Board of Governors, which is led by the Fed chair. There has also been speculation that Trump could turn to his top economic aide, Gary Cohn, for the Fed chair position. A Fed spokesman declined to comment on the process while Warsh and Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.

A new Fed chair would take the helm as the central bank eases well away from crisis-era policies in response to a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, though inflation still lingers below the Fed’s 2-percent goal. Under Yellen, the Fed has raised interest rates and launched a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Much of the latter was accumulated through a controversial bond-buying program that Yellen said helped the economy avert an even deeper downturn. Her term as chair expires in February.  Warsh was a Fed governor between 2006 and 2011 and resigned from the board because of his opposition to the bond-buying program. He has called for a revamp of how the Fed makes monetary policy, saying it needs “fresh air” from markets and from the “real economy.”  Treasury yields spurted higher on news of the Trump meetings; Warsh is viewed as more of a hawk than Yellen. “He’s definitely more hawkish on the spectrum. He is quite a contrast to Yellen. It does seem he is the front-runner even though it’s not a sure thing he will be nominated,” Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said of Warsh. As recently as July, Trump had not ruled out reappointing Yellen, telling the Wall Street Journal that he liked her demeanor and desire to keep interest rates low. In addition to Warsh and Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor’s name also has been floated as a contender. Powell specialized in financial regulatory matters during his five years on the Fed Board of Governors, which is led by the Fed chair. There has also been speculation that Trump could turn to his top economic aide, Gary Cohn, for the Fed chair position. A Fed spokesman declined to comment on the process while Warsh and Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.  ", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is intensifying his search for a new leader of the Federal Reserve, holding meetings with ex-Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and three others, and indicating a decision will be reached next month. Trump informed reporters at the White House that he has met with four potential candidates for Fed chair and aims to make a choice within the next few weeks. While Trump had previously hinted at possibly retaining Janet Yellen as Fed Chair, recent discussions have also included current Fed Governor Jerome Powell as a contender. The process of finding a new Fed chair comes as the central bank gradually shifts away from policies implemented during the financial crisis to adapt to a strengthening economy and declining unemployment rates, while facing persistently low inflation. Yellen, who has overseen interest rate hikes and the reduction of the Fed's balance sheet, will see her term end in February. Warsh, a former Fed governor who opposed the bond-buying program, advocates for reforms in the Fed's approach to monetary policy, emphasizing the need for broader market and economic perspectives. Market reactions suggest that Warsh, characterized as more hawkish than Yellen, may be the frontrunner for the role, although uncertainties remain around the final selection. Other potential candidates include economist John Taylor and the current Fed governor Jerome Powell, who has expertise in financial regulations. Speculation has also arisen about the possibility of Trump considering his economic advisor Gary Cohn for the position. While the selection process continues, both Warsh and Taylor have refrained from commenting, and the Fed has declined to provide details."}

K{\\'o}nya, et al.\nIn a recent publication [2], it was demonstrated that the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian does not arise from the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian through a gauge transformation. This assertion was contested by G. K{\\'o}nya and others in a commentary [1], where they propose the equality of the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian and the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian in the Poincar{\\'e} gauge. Their argument identifies an error and a misinterpretation in our previous work: According to G. K{\\'o}nya and collaborators, the primary error lies in the lack of gauge invariance of the canonical field momentum. They suggest that transformations equivalent to gauge transformations alter the momentum, emphasizing that while the electric field E is gauge-invariant, its appropriateness as the canonical momentum is not guaranteed. The secondary point of contention, as highlighted by G. K{\\'o}nya and colleagues, concerns the emphasis on the necessity of using the canonical coordinate/momentum pair A p and E in the Poincar{\\'e} gauge, which they argue is not obligatory. In the Poincar{\\'e} gauge, G. K{\\'o}nya et al. propose the use of A c as the canonical coordinate, corresponding to the conjugate momentum D, which they assert is more suitable based on the associated nontrivial Dirac brackets. They recommend consulting Table 1 in their article for potential choices.\nWe respectfully disagree with these conclusions and aim to demonstrate in this response their inaccuracies. Specifically, we illustrate that following a gauge transformation, the canonical momentum $\\pi$(x,t) linked to the vector potential A(x,t) is expressed as $\\pi$(x,t) = --$\\epsilon$\\_0 E(x,t). This arises due to the absence of terms proportional to $\\partial$\\_t $\\phi$ (x,t) in the Lagrangian, where $\\phi$ (x,t) denotes the scalar potential. Furthermore, our decision on canonical variables is challenged. In reality, our selection of independent variables mirrors that of G. K{\\'o}nya et al., differing only in our presentation, where we do not explicitly write dependent variables in terms of the independent ones. This distinction underscores a significant advantage of the Dirac procedure for constrained Hamiltonians."}

Initially, quasars with bright, compact cores were the first objects identified with high redshifts (greater than 0.1) before advancements in telescopic technology enabled the discovery of other high-redshift galaxies. Redshift, for galaxies beyond the Local Group and the nearby Virgo Cluster within approximately a thousand megaparsecs, is closely related to the galaxy's distance, a concept initially observed by Edwin Hubble, known as Hubble's law. The correlation between galactic redshifts and distance was first noted by Vesto Slipher in around 1912, with Hubble later developing the law by associating Slipher's measurements with distances calculated through alternative methods. In the prevailing cosmological model founded on general relativity, redshift mainly results from the expansion of space. Consequently, as galaxies are farther from us, the space has expanded more since the light departed from those galaxies, leading to greater light stretching, higher redshift, and a swifter apparent motion away from us. Hubble's law, partly derived from the Copernican principle, often uses redshift measurements due to the ease of measuring redshift compared to direct distance assessments. Gravitational interactions among galaxies and clusters cause variations in the Hubble diagram, where peculiar velocities of galaxies overlay a rough pattern representing the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. These interactions result in phenomena such as blueshifts in nearby galaxies like the Andromeda Galaxy, attributed to the approach towards a common barycenter, and the Fingers of God effect in redshift maps of clusters due to peculiar velocity scatter in an approximately spherical distribution. This additional element aids cosmologists in measuring object masses independently of the mass-to-light ratio, essential for dark matter assessments. The Hubble law's linear connection between distance and redshift presumes a constant Universe expansion rate. However, for galaxies at significant distances, where light travel times are long, the assumption of a stable expansion rate breaks down, leading to a non-linear, integral relationship in the Hubble law dependent on the expansion rate history post light emission. By studying the redshift-distance relationship, insights into the Universe's expansion history and its material and energy composition can be gained. Although the traditional belief was in a continuous decline in the expansion rate post-Big Bang, recent studies of the redshift-distance connection using Type Ia supernovae suggest an acceleration in the Universe's expansion rate in recent eras.\n\n= = = Highest Redshifts = = =\nCurrently, galaxies and gamma ray burst sources hold the highest confirmed redshifts.

Suter then progressed to the University of Wisconsin where Flames scouts observed a growth of two inches in his stature, making him a standout player for his team. Subsequently, Calgary picked him in the 9th round of the 1984 draft. Upon joining the Flames in the 1985-86 season, Suter promptly emerged as the team's top defenseman in the eyes of his coaches and peers. Concluding the season with 18 goals and 68 points, he was honored with the Calder Trophy for being the NHL's top rookie and earned a spot on the All-Rookie Team.

However, their optimistic predictions did not come to fruition. After a couple of seasons at Harvard University, Biotti spent three seasons in the minors in Salt Lake and two more in Europe before retiring without appearing in a single NHL game.\nUsing the second-round pick acquired from Minnesota in the Nilsson deal, Calgary opted for Joe Nieuwendyk from Cornell University, the East Coast Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year. Dubbed \"Joe who?\" by skeptics in the media and among fans, Nieuwendyk ended up having the most extended NHL career of any Flames' pick from that draft. He played in 1,257 games, tallied 1,126 points, secured Stanley Cup victories with Calgary in 1989, the Dallas Stars in 1999, and the New Jersey Devils in 2003, as well as winning a gold medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

", "predictions": "In Brussels, the new prime ministers of Poland and the Czech Republic have arrived for their first EU summit and have affirmed their stance against hosting refugees. Despite ongoing tensions within the EU regarding refugee distribution, countries like Italy and Greece are at odds with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, who have refused to accept refugees. Both Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland and Andrej Babis of the Czech Republic, who recently assumed office, emphasized their predecessors' tough stance on migration. Rather than accepting refugees, Morawiecki proposed allocating funds to support refugees in their home regions, a sentiment echoed by the four eastern prime ministers who collectively pledged 35 million euros to assist migration projects in Libya. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni acknowledged this financial aid but stressed the importance of the eastern states accepting refugees. The issue of refugee relocation remains contentious within the EU, with some member states advocating for mandatory quotas, a proposition opposed by others like Poland and the Czech Republic. The EU leaders are set to discuss this issue during their summit, acknowledging the complexity of finding common ground on such a divisive topic."}

Intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs) share similar observational features but have uncertain origins, possibly originating from electron capture supernovae in super-AGB stars or sudden bursts in dusty luminous blue variables. This study introduces a methodical sample of 8 LRNe and 8 ILRTs detected through the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) project using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). By classifying ZTF transients associated with galaxies within 150 million parsecs, the CLU experiment achieves an 80% detection rate for objects with apparent magnitude below 20. With this sample, a systematic calculation reveals a volumetric rate of 7.8$^{+6.5}_{-3.7}\\times10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for LRNe in the luminosity range of -16 to -11 mag. Notably, the rate of LRNe in this brightness range follows a steeper power law of dN/dL $\\propto L^{-2.5\\pm0.3}$ compared to lower luminosity LRNe events. This suggests a connection with the merger rates predicted by binary population synthesis models. Additionally, findings indicate that the brightest LRNe events (M$_{r}\\leq-13$ mag) may serve as progenitors of double compact objects that merge within a cosmic timeframe. Regarding ILRTs, the derived volumetric rate for events with M$_{\\rm{r}}\\leq-13.5$ is $2.6^{+1.8}_{-1.4}\\times10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, following a similar power law trend of dN/dL $\\propto L^{-2.5\\pm0.5}$.

The main dataset used was from the two J+H NICMOS parallel fields associated with the ACS HUDF, where the 5 sigma detection limits were 28.6 for J and 28.5 for H. Additionally, we considered other fields with less depth, including J+H NICMOS frames from the HDF North, HDF South NICMOS parallel, and ACS HUDF. A key criterion for selection was having a (J-H) color index greater than 1.8, resulting in the identification of 11 potential sources across all search fields. Of these, 8 were excluded as plausible z~10 candidates due to certain characteristics in their spectral signatures. The status of the remaining 3 sources remained inconclusive based on the available data. The total count aligns with the anticipated presence of low-redshift contaminants. Further investigations, including stacked image analyses, pointed towards possible contamination. Even if the three unresolved sources are indeed at z~10, the total number of such sources would not exceed three. By projecting lower redshift samples to z~8-12 and repeating the selection process, it was inferred that there may have been evolution from z~3.8 and possibly from z~6 up to z~10. This trend is in line with previously observed evolution at z~6 and z~7.5 compared to z~3-4. Estimations of the rest-frame UV luminosity density at z~10, down to 0.3 L*, suggest a lower value compared to z~3.8, with a slight uncertainty due to cosmic variance."}

Notably, the C-terminal domain, known as PEPut, interacts with the catalytic domain and shares similarities with domains found in other metabolic enzymes that undergo phosphorylation at a conserved TSH motif, using PEP and ATP to facilitate sugar import and regulatory functions. The study aimed to understand PykA's involvement in replication by analyzing DNA synthesis in mutant strains lacking specific domains, grown in conditions where PykA's metabolic role is not critical for growth. Results revealed that mutations affecting specific parts of the PykA protein led to replication issues, rather than a decrease in its metabolic function. Interestingly, the catalytic and PEPut domains play distinct roles in replication: the catalytic domain influences replication speed both positively and negatively, while PEPut promotes replication initiation through interactions with the catalytic domain under specific growth conditions. Specific residues involved in binding PEP and ADP in the catalytic domain, as well as stabilizing the interaction between the catalytic and PEPut domains, were found to be crucial for PykA's role in replication. In laboratory experiments, PykA was shown to influence the activities of essential replication enzymes, such as polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC, and primase DnaG, which are genetically connected to pykA. Overall, these findings suggest a connection between replication processes and CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP, and ADP), key residues in the catalytic and PEPut domains, and interactions between PykA and replication enzymes. The study proposes that PykA serves a dual function by sensing metabolic signals and coordinating with replication enzymes to adjust replication based on cellular metabolic status, presenting a novel type of replication regulator that contributes to the metabolic control of cell cycle replication."}

We found that the lowest accretion\nrate of $\\dot{m}$ = 0.6 g\\cm$^2$\\s, which corresponds to the nearest source\ndistance and maximum f value, yield the WD mass of $(0.92\\pm0.08) M_{\\odot}$.\nHowever, if the accretion rate is $\\dot{m}$ > ~3 g\\cm$^2$\\s, the WD mass is\nrobustly measured to be $(0.81\\pm0.06) M_{\\odot}$, nearly independent of\n$\\dot{m}$. The derived WD mass range is consistent with the mean WD mass of\nnearby IPs. Assuming spin equilibrium between the WD and accretion disk, we\nconstrained the WD magnetic field to B > ~7 MG, indicating that it could be a\nhighly magnetized IP. Our analysis presents the most comprehensive methodology\nfor constraining the WD mass and B-field of an IP by consolidating the effects\nof cyclotron cooling, finite magnetospheric radius, and accretion column\nheight.\n", "predictions": "We present a detailed study of a Galactic X-ray source, CXOGBS J174517.0-321356 (J1745), which exhibits a periodicity of 614 seconds. Initially detected by Chandra in the Galactic Bulge region, Gong (2022) suggested that J1745 could be classified as either an intermediate polar (IP) with a mass around 1 solar mass, or an ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB). Through a combined analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, we have excluded the possibility of J1745 being a UCXB. Our study introduces a realistic model that accounts for factors such as the finite radius of the magnetosphere, X-ray absorption prior to the shock region, and reflection off the white dwarf (WD) surface to evaluate the properties of the IP, particularly the mass of the WD. To account for uncertainties, we consider a wide range of specific accretion rates (0.6 - 44 g/cm^2/s) based on uncertain values for the source's distance (3-8 kpc) and fractional accretion area (0.001-0.025). Our model accurately incorporates the accretion column height obtained from the X-ray reflection model and compensates for potential underestimations in the mass accretion rate due to unobserved soft X-ray blackbody and cyclotron cooling emissions. Our analysis indicates that the WD mass is estimated to be (0.92±0.08) solar masses at the lowest accretion rate scenario, while for accretion rates above ~3 g/cm^2/s, the WD mass is robustly determined to be (0.81±0.06) solar masses, showing little dependence on the accretion rate. These findings align with the average WD mass of nearby IPs. By assuming spin equilibrium between the WD and the accretion disk, we establish a lower limit of B > ~7 MG for the WD's magnetic field strength, suggesting a highly magnetized IP. Our research represents a comprehensive approach to determining the WD mass and magnetic field strength of an IP, incorporating the effects of cyclotron cooling, finite magnetospheric radius, and accretion column height."}

{"src_passage": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria’s political opposition hopes Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election next week because she has a better understanding of the conflict than Donald Trump, according to members of a delegation holding talks at the United Nations. Khaled Khoja and Hind Kabawat, in Geneva on Monday to press for U.N.-led negotiations on the release of Syrian detainees, said they trusted Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State, to deliver on the opposition’s top priority - protecting civilians. Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” on the ground in Syria to protect non-combatants. Trump says this could “lead to World War Three” due to the potential for conflict with Russia, which is providing military support to President Bashar al-Assad. Kabawat said Trump, who has never held public office and has no foreign policy experience, saw Islamic State, also known as ISIS, as the only alternative to Assad in Syria.  “For us a woman’s leadership at this time would be a good thing. Also for many, like Trump and others, they think that the Syrian conflict is comparing Assad with ISIS and they have to take one side or the other, and of course for them Assad will look more prominent than ISIS,” said Kabawat.  “She (Clinton) knows that is wrong. She knows that there is this moderate opposition that believes in democracy and freedom. This is what we are aiming for, to have a president of the U.S. with good experience who knows the difference between the different oppositions.” Assad, whose forces have regained much territory against their opponents with the help of Russian warplanes, has branded all those opposed to his rule as “terrorists”.  Trump has said defeating Islamic State should be a higher priority than trying to persuade Assad to step aside, a departure from a long-held U.S. policy objective. Khoja, leading the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva, disagreed with this viewpoint. “Dealing with only the ISIS issue will not help with solving the crisis in Syria or the region because the root cause of the crisis is the (Assad) regime itself,” he said. Kabawat, an attorney and a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, added that the Syrian political opposition wanted to see women playing an equal role to men in the nation’s politics. The opposition delegation, which has links to the Free Syrian Army but not with Islamic State or al Qaeda-linked groups, is in Geneva this week to revive the issue of prisoner releases, sidelined during months of fruitless peace talks. Khoja said more than 100 armed groups had shown their willingness to cooperate but there had been no sign of cooperation from Assad’s government or Russia, adding that the United Nations should form a committee on the matter. “If it’s needed, if there is a response from the regime side to release the detainees and stop killings inside Syria, then we can have the representative of the military groups also in this committee, and if the regime wants to send someone to this committee, we can discuss it,” Khoja said.  The Syrian Network of Human Rights has documented more than 90,000 detainees held by the Syrian government, 6,000 held by Islamic State and 2,400 held by the rest of the opposition, but estimates the real numbers are twice as high.

Kabawat said Trump, who has never held public office and has no foreign policy experience, saw Islamic State, also known as ISIS, as the only alternative to Assad in Syria.  “For us a woman’s leadership at this time would be a good thing. Also for many, like Trump and others, they think that the Syrian conflict is comparing Assad with ISIS and they have to take one side or the other, and of course for them Assad will look more prominent than ISIS,” said Kabawat.  “She (Clinton) knows that is wrong. She knows that there is this moderate opposition that believes in democracy and freedom. This is what we are aiming for, to have a president of the U.S. with good experience who knows the difference between the different oppositions.” Assad, whose forces have regained much territory against their opponents with the help of Russian warplanes, has branded all those opposed to his rule as “terrorists”.  Trump has said defeating Islamic State should be a higher priority than trying to persuade Assad to step aside, a departure from a long-held U.S. policy objective. Khoja, leading the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva, disagreed with this viewpoint. “Dealing with only the ISIS issue will not help with solving the crisis in Syria or the region because the root cause of the crisis is the (Assad) regime itself,” he said. Kabawat, an attorney and a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, added that the Syrian political opposition wanted to see women playing an equal role to men in the nation’s politics. The opposition delegation, which has links to the Free Syrian Army but not with Islamic State or al Qaeda-linked groups, is in Geneva this week to revive the issue of prisoner releases, sidelined during months of fruitless peace talks. Khoja said more than 100 armed groups had shown their willingness to cooperate but there had been no sign of cooperation from Assad’s government or Russia, adding that the United Nations should form a committee on the matter. “If it’s needed, if there is a response from the regime side to release the detainees and stop killings inside Syria, then we can have the representative of the military groups also in this committee, and if the regime wants to send someone to this committee, we can discuss it,” Khoja said.  The Syrian Network of Human Rights has documented more than 90,000 detainees held by the Syrian government, 6,000 held by Islamic State and 2,400 held by the rest of the opposition, but estimates the real numbers are twice as high.  ", "predictions": "In Geneva, members of a delegation from Syria's political opposition expressed their preference for Hillary Clinton to win the upcoming U.S. presidential election, citing her superior grasp of the conflict compared to Donald Trump. The delegation, led by Khaled Khoja and Hind Kabawat, emphasized their trust in Clinton's ability to prioritize the protection of civilians, highlighting her support for establishing no-fly zones and safe areas in Syria. They criticized Trump for viewing the Syrian conflict as a choice between Bashar al-Assad and ISIS, noting his lack of political experience and foreign policy knowledge. The delegation stressed the importance of a U.S. president who understands the nuances of the situation, including the existence of moderate opposition groups seeking democracy and freedom. Assad has dismissed his opponents as terrorists, while Trump has suggested focusing on defeating ISIS rather than addressing the root cause of the crisis, which the delegation believes is the Assad regime itself. They called for greater female representation in Syrian politics and urged for action on releasing detainees, with Khoja proposing the formation of a United Nations committee for this purpose. The Syrian Network of Human Rights has documented a large number of detainees held by various parties, highlighting the urgent need for humanitarian action."}

Despite the erroneous tale of his transfer, Ã†thelred was indeed consecrated as Archbishop in 870. The reasons for his selection for the Canterbury position remain unknown, given the absence of contemporary records regarding his election.\nDuring his time as Archbishop, Ã†thelred grappled with the repercussions of Viking incursions, in addition to a disagreement with King Alfred the Great regarding royal influence over ecclesiastical matters. Notably, under Ã†thelred's leadership, the Golden Gospels, an 8th-century gospel book, were rescued from raiders and presented to Canterbury. Pope John VIII urged Ã†thelred and Archbishop Wulfhere of York to reform the attire of the English clergy, which clashed with Roman customs of wearing long clerical garments.

Although the specifics of the conflict are ambiguous, historical records confirm the pope's reply to the archbishop. The pope reassured Ã†thelred of papal support for Canterbury and informed him that he had advised the king to respect the archbishop's rights. Some historians, like Justin Pollard, view this correspondence as evidence of papal backing for Alfred's removal, allegedly supported by Ã†thelred.

Observations carried out with Gemini-North roughly 9.1 hours post-burst unveil a dim optical afterglow with a magnitude of approximately 25.1 in the i band, positioned at an angular distance of 0.59 ± 0.16 arcseconds from its host galaxy. By analyzing data from observations in multiple filters (grizYJHK), we derive a photometric redshift for the host galaxy of z = 1.77, with uncertainties of +0.30 and -0.17. Through a combination of spectroscopic data obtained with both Gemini and Keck telescopes, covering a wavelength range of 4500-18000 Å, we identify a single emission line at 13390 Å, determined to be Hβ at a redshift of 1.754 ± 0.001, aligning with the photometric redshift measurement. The characteristics of the host galaxy of GRB 181123B are consistent with those of other hosts of short gamma-ray bursts, displaying an estimated stellar mass of around 1.7 x 10^10 solar masses, a mass-weighted age of roughly 0.9 billion years, and an optical luminosity close to 0.9 times that of L*. \nGRB 181123B, situated at a redshift of 1.754, stands as the most distant securely identified short gamma-ray burst with an optical afterglow detection, and among only three such cases at redshifts exceeding 1.5. Given the increasing number of high-redshift short gamma-ray bursts, we investigate the impact of a potentially missing population of bursts at redshifts above 1.5 within the current Swift sample on models of delay time distribution. Our analysis suggests that log-normal models with average delay times of around 4-6 billion years are in line with the observed distribution but could be eliminated at a confidence level of 95% with the retrieval of approximately 1-5 additional Swift short gamma-ray bursts at redshifts above 1.5. Conversely, power-law models with a dependence on time to the power of -1 are consistent with the redshift distribution and could accommodate up to roughly 30 bursts at these redshifts. In this scenario, we anticipate that around one-third of the existing Swift short gamma-ray burst population is located at redshifts surpassing 1. The identification or rediscovery of short gamma-ray bursts at high redshifts in the future will significantly contribute to refining our understanding of their delay time distributions and, consequently, their formation mechanisms."}

Brazil s Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot had told a news conference on Monday that he was considering revoking a plea bargain deal struck by Batista and a fellow state s witness after they appeared to have inadvertently recorded themselves discussing crimes not covered in the deal. The source, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that Janot had requested the arrest of Batista and Ricardo Saud, a former executive at the Batista family holding company J&F Investimentos, based on the four-hour recording. Janot s office did not respond to calls and email requests for comment. Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley confessed to bribing scores of politicians in plea bargain testimony that allowed them to avoid prosecution. Amongst the evidence they provided to prosecutors was a recording of President Michel Temer apparently endorsing hush payments to a possible witness in a graft probe.  The source said that Janot had revoked the benefits granted under the plea bargain deal to Joesley and Ricardo Saud, a former executive of holding company J&F Investimentos, through which the Batista family controls JBS.  He also asked Supreme Court Justice Edson Facchin to authorize the arrest of a former prosecutor, Marcelo Miller, the source said.  The taped conversation, which was made public by the Supreme Court this week, was inadvertently submitted to prosecutors with unrelated material last week.  In it, Batista and Saud say Miller helped the Batista brothers strike their plea bargain before leaving the Prosecutors Office in April to work in a private law firm. In a statement this week, J&F said Batista and Saud were simply discussing hypotheses in the conversation, not facts. Batista s lawyer, Pierpaolo Bottini, filed a request on Saturday for the Supreme Court to hear defense arguments before authorizing the arrest of his client and Saud. The lawyer also said Batista and Ricardo Saud are willing to surrender their passports.  A lawyer for Miller, Andr  Perecmanis, said on Saturday his client did not help the Batistas in their plea deal while working as a prosecutor.  Another source with knowledge of the matter said the leniency agreement of J&F Investimentos SA, which the company signed in May agreeing to pay a record leniency fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.3 billion) for its role in the political bribery scheme, had been validated on Friday by a federal court. The source, asking for anonymity to discuss the matter freely, said that if a plea bargain by J&F Investimentos is canceled, the leniency agreement may also lose effect. A string of asset sales depend on the validity of the leniency agreement.  In three months, the holding company has signed agreements to sell Havaianas flip-flops maker Alpargatas SA ALPA4.SA, dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA and pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA, but the sales may only be finalized if the leniency agreement is still valid.

In it, Batista and Saud say Miller helped the Batista brothers strike their plea bargain before leaving the Prosecutors Office in April to work in a private law firm. In a statement this week, J&F said Batista and Saud were simply discussing hypotheses in the conversation, not facts. Batista s lawyer, Pierpaolo Bottini, filed a request on Saturday for the Supreme Court to hear defense arguments before authorizing the arrest of his client and Saud. The lawyer also said Batista and Ricardo Saud are willing to surrender their passports.  A lawyer for Miller, Andr  Perecmanis, said on Saturday his client did not help the Batistas in their plea deal while working as a prosecutor.  Another source with knowledge of the matter said the leniency agreement of J&F Investimentos SA, which the company signed in May agreeing to pay a record leniency fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.3 billion) for its role in the political bribery scheme, had been validated on Friday by a federal court. The source, asking for anonymity to discuss the matter freely, said that if a plea bargain by J&F Investimentos is canceled, the leniency agreement may also lose effect. A string of asset sales depend on the validity of the leniency agreement.  In three months, the holding company has signed agreements to sell Havaianas flip-flops maker Alpargatas SA ALPA4.SA, dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA and pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA, but the sales may only be finalized if the leniency agreement is still valid.  ", "predictions": "Brazil's top prosecutor has requested the Supreme Court to approve the detention of Joesley Batista, a billionaire and co-owner of JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker, as per an individual familiar with the situation. The Prosecutor-General, Rodrigo Janot, indicated during a press conference earlier that he was contemplating rescinding a plea bargain deal made by Batista and an accomplice after they inadvertently recorded conversations about illegal activities not covered in the agreement. The anonymous source revealed that Janot had sought the arrest of Batista and Ricardo Saud, a former executive at J&F Investimentos, the Batista family's holding company, based on a lengthy recording. There has been no response from Janot's office to inquiries regarding this matter. Batista and his brother Wesley admitted to bribing numerous politicians in their plea bargain testimony, providing evidence, including a recording of President Michel Temer endorsing secret payments in a corruption investigation. Janot has reportedly cancelled the benefits granted to Joesley and Saud under the plea bargain deal, and has also sought the approval for the arrest of former prosecutor Marcelo Miller. Recent events revealed a conversation where Batista and Saud implicated Miller in facilitating their plea bargain before he left the Prosecutors Office and joined a private law firm. J&F defended the conversation as hypothetical, not factual. Batista's lawyer has requested a hearing before the Supreme Court to present their defense, and both Batista and Saud are prepared to surrender their passports. Miller's lawyer denied any involvement in assisting the Batistas during his time as a prosecutor. Additionally, a separate source disclosed that the leniency agreement of J&F Investimentos was validated by a federal court, securing a record leniency fine for their involvement in a bribery scandal. The effectiveness of this agreement is crucial for the completion of asset sales by J&F, including Alpargatas SA, Vigor Alimentos SA, and Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA. If the leniency agreement is voided, these sales may be impacted."}

The Republicans said Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has refused their requests for full briefings of Congress’ two intelligence committees. U.S. government officials said the leaders of Congress and the chairmen of the two intelligence committees, known as the “Gang of Eight,” have been briefed on the Central Intelligence Agency’s conclusion. Nevertheless, Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and is a member of President-elect Trump’s transition team as well as the Gang of Eight, has called for a briefing for his entire committee on the CIA assessment. “The committee is vigorously looking into reports of cyber-attacks during the election campaign, and in particular we want to clarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us,” Nunes said.Representative Ron Johnson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said his panel also has asked for a briefing but the CIA refused. “It is disappointing that the CIA would provide information on this issue to the Washington Post and NBC but will not provide information to elected members of Congress,” Johnson said in a statement on Friday. Three U.S. government sources, who all asked for anonymity to discuss classified information, told Reuters that while the full congressional committees have not been briefed, the congressional leadership has, which is the standard procedure for briefing Congress on sensitive intelligence. The sources said that Nunes was personally briefed on the CIA finding. A congressional official denied Nunes was briefed, however. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement that because President Barack Obama last week ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full-scale “review of foreign efforts to influence recent presidential elections – from 2008 to the present,” the agencies would not comment further until the study is completed. ODNI, which oversees all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, said that when the review is complete, the U.S. intelligence community “stands ready to brief Congress.” The office said it also would make the study “available to the public consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods.” The CIA based its conclusion about Russia hacking to influence the election not on irrefutable evidence but largely on its analysis of the fact that the Russians hacked both political parties while only publicizing information damaging to Democrats and their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, said a U.S. official familiar with the agency’s work, who also requested anonymity. Two of the government sources said on Friday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation now backs the CIA assessment that the Russian hacks were aimed at helping Trump win. The ODNI also agrees with the assessment, all three government sources said. There was no immediate comment from the FBI. The FBI, which has responsibility for counterintelligence investigations inside the United States, initially did not endorse the CIA’s finding because it did not meet the standards of evidence necessary to win a conviction in a U.S. court or identify individuals whose hacking violated American law, one source said.The debate over Russian hacking also is opening a rift between Trump and some Republican members of Congress. The president-elect continues to dismiss the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed the hacking. On Friday, Senator Richard Burr, Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced his committee will conduct a review in the new year of U.S. intelligence on Russian activities and its cyber activity more broadly.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Tuesday pressed Facebook Inc’s chief lawyer on why the company did not catch 2016 election ads bought using Russian rubles, why its investigation of them took so long and how much it knows about its 5 million advertisers. Democrats and Republicans at the Senate crime subcommittee hearing fired questions for much of two hours at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who said that in retrospect the company should have done more.  “In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens. There are signals we missed,” Stretch said under questioning from Democratic Senator Al Franken about how the company missed political ads bought with Russian money. Stretch called the Russia-based ads “reprehensible” for their political divisiveness. The hearing marked the first time tech executives have appeared publicly before U.S. lawmakers on the Russia matter, and the tone represented a dramatic shift in fortunes for Silicon Valley, which for years has grown accustomed to favorable regulatory treatment in the United States.  Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senators’ ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.  Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.  “I suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up,” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.  Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.  The Russian government has denied it intended to influence  the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.   Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.  Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebook’s disclosures.  “Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem?” Democratic Senator Chris Coons asked.  Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last year’s election, “we weren’t sitting around.” The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.  Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads. It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers. Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.  Republican Senator John Kennedy told Stretch that he doubted Facebook’s ability to stop people overseas from buying U.S. election ads. U.S. law bars election spending by non-Americans. “You’ve got 5 million advertisers and you’re going to tell me that you’re able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?” Kennedy asked Stretch.  The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.  Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially. The internet is borderless.”   Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.  The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he was elevating the status of the Pentagon’s U.S. Cyber Command to help spur development of cyber weapons to deter attacks and punish intruders. In a statement, Trump said the unit would be ranked at the level of Unified Combatant Command focused on cyberspace operations. Cyber Command’s elevation reflects a push to strengthen U.S. capabilities to interfere with the military programs of adversaries such as North Korea’s nuclear and missile development and Islamic State’s ability to recruit, inspire and direct attacks, three U.S. intelligence officials said this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Cyber Command had been subordinate to the U.S. Strategic Command, which is also responsible for military space operations, nuclear weapons and missile defense. Once elevated, Cyber Command would have the same status as U.S. Strategic Command and eight other unified commands that control U.s. military forces and are composed of personnel from multiple branches of the armed services.  The Pentagon did not specify how long the elevation process would take. Current and former officials said a leading candidate to head U.S. Cyber Command was Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, currently director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff. Trump also said the defense secretary was also considering separating the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency (NSA). Cyber Command’s mission is to shut down and, when ordered, counter cyber attacks. The NSA’s role is to gather intelligence and generally favors monitoring enemies’ cyber activities. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both strong voices on security matters, praised the move and said it would boost the command’s abilities.  Still, McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said more steps were needed to meet the nation’s cyber security challenges. “We must develop a clear policy and strategy for deterring and responding to cyber threats.

In a statement, Trump said the unit would be ranked at the level of Unified Combatant Command focused on cyberspace operations. Cyber Command’s elevation reflects a push to strengthen U.S. capabilities to interfere with the military programs of adversaries such as North Korea’s nuclear and missile development and Islamic State’s ability to recruit, inspire and direct attacks, three U.S. intelligence officials said this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Cyber Command had been subordinate to the U.S. Strategic Command, which is also responsible for military space operations, nuclear weapons and missile defense. Once elevated, Cyber Command would have the same status as U.S. Strategic Command and eight other unified commands that control U.s. military forces and are composed of personnel from multiple branches of the armed services.  The Pentagon did not specify how long the elevation process would take. Current and former officials said a leading candidate to head U.S. Cyber Command was Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, currently director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff. Trump also said the defense secretary was also considering separating the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency (NSA). Cyber Command’s mission is to shut down and, when ordered, counter cyber attacks. The NSA’s role is to gather intelligence and generally favors monitoring enemies’ cyber activities. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both strong voices on security matters, praised the move and said it would boost the command’s abilities.  Still, McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said more steps were needed to meet the nation’s cyber security challenges. “We must develop a clear policy and strategy for deterring and responding to cyber threats. We must also develop an integrated, whole-of-government approach to protect and defend the United States from cyberattacks,” he said in a statement.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he is upgrading the status of the Pentagon's U.S. Cyber Command with the aim of advancing cyber weaponry development to prevent attacks and punish offenders. Trump stated that the unit will now be classified as a Unified Combatant Command specifically dedicated to cyber operations. This move to elevate Cyber Command signals a concerted effort to bolster U.S. capacities in disrupting the military activities of adversaries like North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and the Islamic State's recruitment and orchestration of attacks, revealed three U.S. intelligence officials who chose to remain anonymous. Previously, Cyber Command fell under the authority of the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees military space operations, nuclear weapons, and missile defense. By granting it the same status as the U.S. Strategic Command and the other unified commands responsible for U.S. military forces comprising personnel from various armed service branches, Cyber Command is poised to play a more prominent role. The timeline for this elevation was not provided by the Pentagon. Speculation suggests that Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, the current director of the Pentagon's Joint Staff, is a leading candidate to lead U.S. Cyber Command. In addition to the elevation, there is a proposal to separate the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency (NSA). While Cyber Command is tasked with shutting down and countering cyber threats as required, the NSA focuses on intelligence gathering, particularly monitoring adversaries' cyber activities. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, influential figures in national security discussions, lauded the decision, highlighting the potential to enhance the command's capabilities. However, McCain emphasized the need for additional measures to address the country's cybersecurity challenges, stressing the importance of formulating a comprehensive policy and strategy to prevent and respond to cyber threats. The establishment of the new combatant command is expected to enhance the U.S.' capacity to retaliate against foreign cyber incursions and discourage efforts to disrupt crucial American infrastructure like financial systems, power grids, and healthcare networks. This initiative is likened to the nuclear deterrence doctrine of \"mutual assured destruction\" from the Cold War era between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, according to the three U.S. officials. The U.S. faces greater vulnerability to cyber intrusions compared to its most sophisticated adversaries such as China, Russia, and North Korea due to its heavy reliance on the internet for economic activities, noted two officials. As other countries advance their communication networks, they will become increasingly susceptible to cyber threats."}

According to a source familiar with Garland’s sentiments, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \"is dedicated to his current role and has no intention of leaving the judiciary.\" Cornyn stated that he believes his best service lies in advocating for a conservative agenda in the Senate.

Other potential candidates, including Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, have also indicated their lack of interest in the director position. \n\nThe challenges in filling crucial administration roles extend beyond the FBI directorship. Trump's management style, characterized by contradicting advisors, demanding loyalty, and penalizing dissent, has dissuaded experienced individuals from pursuing roles within the administration. This has led to difficulties in attracting qualified personnel to work in the current administration, with some seasoned professionals opting to resign or seek opportunities elsewhere."}

{"src_passage": "  We investigate the Milky Way Galaxy's radial and vertical metallicity\ngradients using a sample of 47,406 red clump stars from the RAVE DR4. This\nsample is more than twice the size of the largest sample in the literature\ninvestigating radial and vertical metallicity gradients. The absolute magnitude\nof Groenewegen (2008) is used to determine distances to our sample stars. The\nresulting distances agree with the RAVE DR4 distances Binney et al. (2014) of\nthe same stars. Our photometric method also provides distances to 6185 stars\nthat are not assigned a distance in RAVE DR4. The metallicity gradients are\ncalculated with their current orbital positions ($R_{gc}$ and $Z$) and with\ntheir orbital properties (mean Galactocentric distance, $R_{m}$ and $z_{max}$),\nas a function of the distance to the Galactic plane:\nd[Fe/H]/d$R_{gc}=$-$0.047\\pm0.003$ dex/kpc for $0\\leq |Z|\\leq0.5$ kpc and\nd[Fe/H]/d$R_m=$-$0.025\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc for $0\\leq z_{max}\\leq0.5$ kpc. This\nreaffirms the radial metallicity gradient in the thin disc but highlights that\ngradients are sensitive to the selection effects caused by the difference\nbetween $R_{gc}$ and $R_{m}$. The radial gradient is flat in the distance\ninterval 0.5-1 kpc from the plane and then becomes positive greater than 1 kpc\nfrom the plane. The radial metallicity gradients are also eccentricity\ndependent.

Our approach also yielded distances for 6185 stars that lacked distance assignments in RAVE DR4.

This process can be visualized as particles hopping between neighboring adsorption sites on a surface, as illustrated in figure 1. Similar to bulk diffusion, this movement is primarily driven by thermal energy, leading to faster rates at higher temperatures. While many systems exhibit diffusion patterns that do not follow the traditional nearest-neighbor jumping model, tunneling diffusion provides a fascinating example of an unconventional mechanism where hydrogen diffuses on clean metal surfaces through quantum tunneling.\n\nAnalytical techniques such as field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy are crucial in studying surface diffusion mechanisms and rates. Although surface diffusion can occur on various materials in theory, experiments mainly focus on crystalline metal surfaces due to practical limitations. Most studies on surface diffusion are carried out below the substrate's melting point, leaving much to be explored about these processes at elevated temperatures.\n\nSurface diffusion rates and mechanisms are influenced by factors like the strength of surface-adparticle bonds, surface lattice orientation, interactions between surface species, and gradients in chemical potential. Understanding surface diffusion is vital for applications in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other areas of surface science, playing a key role in industries such as chemical production and semiconductor manufacturing. Applications such as catalytic converters, integrated circuits in electronics, and silver halide salts for photographic film heavily rely on the principles of surface diffusion.\n\n= Kinetics =\n\nSurface diffusion kinetics involve adatoms residing at adsorption sites on a 2D lattice, moving between adjacent sites through a jumping process. The jump rate is determined by an attempt frequency and a thermodynamic factor that influences the likelihood of a successful jump. The attempt frequency, usually the vibrational frequency of the adatom, combined with the thermodynamic factor (a Boltzmann factor dependent on temperature and Ediff, the potential energy barrier to diffusion) can be expressed by Equation 1.\n\nIn this equation, with Î½ and Ediff as previously defined, Î“ represents the jump rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. For diffusion to occur, Ediff must be lower than the desorption energy; otherwise, desorption processes would dominate. Notably, Equation 1 highlights the significant impact of temperature on the jump rate. The manner of diffusion depends on the relationship between Ediff and kBT, where when Ediff < kBT, the thermodynamic factor approaches unity, rendering Ediff a negligible barrier to diffusion. This scenario, known as mobile diffusion, is rare and observed in only a few systems. For the phenomena discussed here, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT, ensuring that Î“ << Î½. When dealing with Fickian diffusion, both Î½ and Ediff can be extracted from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. In cases with multiple diffusion mechanisms, more than one Ediff may exist, leading to changes in the dominance of different processes with temperature fluctuations.\n\nThe mean squared displacement of diffusing species is described by random walk statistics in terms of the number of jumps (N) and the distance per jump (a). The number of successful jumps equals Î“ multiplied by the diffusion time, t. In a basic model focusing on nearest-neighbor jumps, a corresponds to the distance between adjacent adsorption sites. The root mean squared displacement is proportional to a certain equation (Eq. 2). The diffusion coefficient, D, is given by the formula D."}

Despite numerous Pakistanis being sentenced to death for allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammad, no executions have been carried out yet. Over 500 backers of the Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan party, also known as the Movement of the Prophet's Followers, voiced their support while leaders addressed them from a cargo truck, vowing to defend Pakistan's blasphemy regulations with their lives. The demonstrators demanded the immediate resignation of Law Minister Zahid Hamid, whom they labeled as a blasphemer for his involvement in the law amendment. A speaker at the protest urged Hamid to come forward and seek forgiveness. Two legal practitioners who participated in the demonstration vowed to push forward Labaik's objectives in the legal system. One of the lawyers accused Hamid of disrespecting the blasphemy laws, which carry a death penalty as punishment. Pakistan's interior ministry did not respond to inquiries from Reuters. The ruling party, Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), stirred controversy recently by modifying the oath in electoral laws, leading to accusations of blasphemy from religious factions. Although the government expressed regret in parliament for what it deemed a clerical error, the apology failed to appease Tehreek-e-Labaik, prompting the protest after a lengthy march from Lahore. Despite not being expected to significantly increase its votes, Tehrik-e-Labaik's sudden ascension poses a potential challenge to the PML-N. Truck drivers held up at roadblocks by city authorities on a bridge near the protest site lamented delivery delays, while a commuter unable to reach work due to the disruptions shared his financial losses."}

Initially intended as a platform to republish stories from Planet Stories, it faced a short-lived existence of just two editions. While lacking original content, the magazine did showcase original artwork, including early pieces by Kelly Freas.

By the end of 1949, nearly all major magazines in the genre were in pulp format. However, by the close of 1955, most had either shut down or transitioned to digest format. Despite the decline of pulp publications, a few new science fiction magazines emerged during this period, with Tops in Science Fiction being among the final ones. Love Romances Inc., the publisher also behind Planet Stories, capitalized on Planet's extensive collection of stories and artwork spanning 14 years. The magazine's inception in 1953 was influenced by a similar strategy employed by Standard Magazines' Fantastic Story Magazine, even though Fantastic Story faced financial challenges by that time.\n\nThe first issue, published in Spring 1953 and helmed by Jack O'Sullivan, featured cover art by Alexander Leydenfrost borrowed from a 1942 Planet Stories issue. Content included works like Isaac Asimov's \"Black Friar of the Flame\" and Ray Bradbury's \"The Million Year Picnic.\" The decision to switch to a digest format for the second issue in Fall 1953 was driven by distribution difficulties and the increasing popularity of digest publications. Despite contributions from notable figures like Freas and stories by authors such as Bradbury and Leigh Brackett, the magazine failed to gain widespread distribution, leading to its discontinuation.\n\n= = Publication Details = =\n\nTops in Science Fiction comprised two issues, released in Spring and Fall 1953, with the first in pulp format and the second in digest format.

Jack O'Sullivan and Malcolm Reiss served as editors for the first and second issues, respectively.\n\nA British reprint edition featuring three 128-page digest editions was published by Top Fiction Ltd. between Autumn 1954 and Summer 1956. While the first two editions reprinted content from the initial U.S. issue, the third edition featured material from the second U.S. release. Priced at 1/6 each, these reprints did not carry specific dates but provided an opportunity for readers in the UK to access the magazine's content."}

There is apprehension within the EPA about potential budget cuts, program reductions, and curtailment of scientific research under the new administration. Some Republican lawmakers have recently intensified pressure on the EPA, with Rep. Lamar Smith requesting an investigation by the EPA’s inspector general into allegations that EPA staff are using encrypted messages to obstruct the new administration's policies. Furthermore, Rep. Matt Gaetz introduced a bill with the aim to eliminate the EPA, although the bill is not expected to pass."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - Five Republican senators called on Friday for Washington to retaliate for an alleged sonic attack, inaudible to some human ears, on U.S. personnel in Cuba by expelling Cuban diplomats and possibly closing the U.S. embassy in Havana. In August, the State Department said Americans linked to the U.S. embassy in the capital had experienced physical symptoms caused by such “incidents,” involving sound waves, starting as far back as late 2016. Five Canadians in Havana were also affected.  In some cases the victims heard nothing, while others sensed deafening sound, but all suffered symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and temporary hearing or memory loss. The incidents have left a sense of unease among Havana’s diplomatic community, various diplomats said, and the Cuban Foreign Ministry has not provided any explanation to date. A months-long investigation by Cuba, the United States and Canada into the mysterious affair, unprecedented in modern diplomatic history, has yet to come up with answers as to how the attacks took place, let alone who was behind them. Cuba has denied involvement. The U.S. State Department has not blamed Havana for the attacks, but asked two Cuban diplomats to leave Washington in May. Canada does not intend to take diplomatic action “at this time,” an official said in August. In a letter, the five Republicans - Senators Tom Cotton, Richard Burr, John Cornyn, Marco Rubio and James Lankford - urged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to remind the Cuban government of its responsibility toward diplomats. “Furthermore, we ask that you immediately declare all accredited Cuban diplomats in the United States persona non grata and, if Cuba does not take tangible action, close the U.S. Embassy in Havana,” they wrote. All five are members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels looking into the matter. Burr is its chairman and Cornyn is the number two Republican in the Senate. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress. The letter came as the United States was expected to issue new, tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba, as part of a partial rollback of the U.S.-Cuban detente by President Donald Trump. Rubio, a Cuban-American, was a key player in forging the new, more hostile policy toward the island. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. The seaside U.S. embassy in Havana was still closed due to damage in the wake of Hurricane Irma, with staff working from the ambassador’s residence and from home. A source close to the investigation underway on the island said the Cubans had been very cooperative, even offering to let the FBI in to investigate for example. “As far as we have ever known, the U.S. officials here in Cuba have never suspected the Cubans as perpetrating these events,” the source said. Foreign policy experts say it is hard to see what Cuba would have to gain from perpetrating attacks on diplomats. It has enjoyed good relations with Canada for many years and in 2014 started to normalize relations with its old Cold War enemy the United States. Theories abound. One is that another country like Russia, Iran or North Korea might want to drive a wedge between Cuba and the west. Another is that there is an internal power struggle underway on the island.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - A group of five Republican senators have called for retaliatory actions following an alleged sonic attack, which some individuals could not hear, on U.S. personnel in Cuba. The senators suggested expelling Cuban diplomats and potentially shutting down the U.S. embassy in Havana. The State Department previously reported that individuals associated with the U.S. embassy in Cuba began experiencing physical symptoms from as early as late 2016 due to these \"incidents\" involving sound waves. Even five Canadians in Havana were affected. The symptoms ranged from nausea, dizziness, to temporary hearing or memory loss. The source of the attacks remains a mystery despite a thorough investigation by Cuba, the U.S., and Canada, leaving Havana's diplomatic community unsettled. The Cuban Foreign Ministry has not provided any explanation so far, and Cuba has denied any involvement. The U.S. State Department, while not directly accusing Havana, had expelled two Cuban diplomats in May. In a joint letter, the senators - Tom Cotton, Richard Burr, John Cornyn, Marco Rubio, and James Lankford - pressed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to remind the Cuban government of its duty toward diplomats and proposed declaring all Cuban diplomats in the U.S. persona non grata if immediate action is not taken by Cuba. The Republicans, all members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, seek accountability from Cuba amid escalating tensions. President Trump's party holds the majority in Congress, potentially influencing policy decisions in this matter. The developments occurred as the U.S. planned to impose stricter travel restrictions on Americans in Cuba, reversing parts of the U.S.-Cuban rapprochement under Trump's administration. Rubio, a key advocate for tougher policies on Cuba, played a pivotal role in shaping the more aggressive stance. The U.S. embassy in Havana remains closed after Hurricane Irma, with operations shifted to the ambassador's residence and remote work. Despite Cuba's cooperation in the investigation, the culprits and motives behind the attacks remain unclear. Various speculations suggest involvement of other nations like Russia, Iran, or North Korea, aiming to disrupt Cuba's relations with the west or internal power struggles within the island."}

{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declined an offer to meet U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House later this month and canceled his trip to Washington, the White House said on Monday. Netanyahu’s decision to nix his U.S. visit marked the latest episode in a fraught relationship with Obama that has yet to recover from their deep differences over last year’s U.S.-led international nuclear deal with Iran, Israel’s arch foe. The White House said the Israeli government had requested a Netanyahu meeting with Obama on either March 18 or 19 and that two weeks ago he was offered a March 18 encounter. “We were looking forward to hosting the bilateral meeting, and we were surprised to first learn via media reports that the prime minister, rather than accept our invitation, opted to cancel his visit,” White House spokesman Ned Price said in an emailed statement. “Reports that we were not able to accommodate the prime minister’s schedule are false,” he said. The White House has announced Obama’s plans to be in Havana on March 21 and 22 for a historic visit aimed at moving closer toward normalized relations with Washington’s former Cold War adversary. There was no immediate word from Netanyahu’s office about the cancellation, which also comes as the two close allies are struggling to negotiate a new 10-year, multibillion-dollar defense aid agreement for Israel. Israel’s Channel 10 TV, citing unnamed Israeli sources, said Netanyahu’s decision to scrap the trip appeared to be motivated by reluctance to be perceived as interfering in the U.S. presidential election campaign, should any candidates seek to meet him in Washington.  Netanyahu also saw little to show for such a trip, given that the new defense Memorandum of Understanding is “far from being agreed yet,” Channel 10 said. Several Israeli media quoted Israeli officials as saying that no appropriate time could be found for the meeting before Obama’s departure for Cuba. Netanyahu had been expected to visit Washington this month not only to see Obama but to address the annual conference of the leading U.S. pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC. In the past he has sometimes spoken to the group via satellite. The prime minister made a speech to the U.S. Congress last March criticizing the then-emerging Iran nuclear deal and was denied a meeting with Obama during that visit in what was widely regarded as a diplomatic snub. But the two leaders met at the White House in November and sought to mend ties. In recent months, differences over defense aid have underscored continuing tensions over the Iran deal. Netanyahu and his aides suggested in February if Israel were unable to reach an accord with Obama, it could wait for the next  president to secure better terms.

Netanyahu’s decision to nix his U.S. visit marked the latest episode in a fraught relationship with Obama that has yet to recover from their deep differences over last year’s U.S.-led international nuclear deal with Iran, Israel’s arch foe. The White House said the Israeli government had requested a Netanyahu meeting with Obama on either March 18 or 19 and that two weeks ago he was offered a March 18 encounter. “We were looking forward to hosting the bilateral meeting, and we were surprised to first learn via media reports that the prime minister, rather than accept our invitation, opted to cancel his visit,” White House spokesman Ned Price said in an emailed statement. “Reports that we were not able to accommodate the prime minister’s schedule are false,” he said. The White House has announced Obama’s plans to be in Havana on March 21 and 22 for a historic visit aimed at moving closer toward normalized relations with Washington’s former Cold War adversary. There was no immediate word from Netanyahu’s office about the cancellation, which also comes as the two close allies are struggling to negotiate a new 10-year, multibillion-dollar defense aid agreement for Israel. Israel’s Channel 10 TV, citing unnamed Israeli sources, said Netanyahu’s decision to scrap the trip appeared to be motivated by reluctance to be perceived as interfering in the U.S. presidential election campaign, should any candidates seek to meet him in Washington.  Netanyahu also saw little to show for such a trip, given that the new defense Memorandum of Understanding is “far from being agreed yet,” Channel 10 said. Several Israeli media quoted Israeli officials as saying that no appropriate time could be found for the meeting before Obama’s departure for Cuba. Netanyahu had been expected to visit Washington this month not only to see Obama but to address the annual conference of the leading U.S. pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC. In the past he has sometimes spoken to the group via satellite. The prime minister made a speech to the U.S. Congress last March criticizing the then-emerging Iran nuclear deal and was denied a meeting with Obama during that visit in what was widely regarded as a diplomatic snub. But the two leaders met at the White House in November and sought to mend ties. In recent months, differences over defense aid have underscored continuing tensions over the Iran deal. Netanyahu and his aides suggested in February if Israel were unable to reach an accord with Obama, it could wait for the next  president to secure better terms.

", "predictions": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to meet with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House later this month and has called off his visit to Washington, as announced by the White House on Monday. Netanyahu's decision to cancel his trip to the U.S. is the latest development in a strained relationship with Obama that has not fully recovered from their significant disagreements over the international nuclear agreement with Iran last year, a country that is a major adversary of Israel. According to the White House, the Israeli government had asked for a meeting between Netanyahu and Obama on March 18 or 19, and two weeks ago, a meeting on March 18 was offered. \"We were anticipating the opportunity to host the meeting, and it came as a surprise to us when we first learned through the media that the prime minister, instead of accepting our invitation, chose to cancel his visit,\" stated White House spokesman Ned Price in an email. He also refuted claims that the White House was unable to accommodate Netanyahu's schedule. The White House has announced that Obama will be in Havana on March 21 and 22 for a historic visit aimed at improving relations with Cuba. There has been no immediate response from Netanyahu's office regarding the cancellation, which comes at a time when the two allies are facing challenges in negotiating a new long-term defense aid agreement for Israel. Israeli media sources suggested that Netanyahu's decision to call off the trip may have been influenced by concerns about potential involvement in the U.S. presidential election campaign if candidates sought to meet with him in Washington. Additionally, it was noted that a meeting with Obama would not have yielded substantial progress, given that the defense agreement was still far from being finalized. Israeli officials cited difficulties in finding a suitable time for the meeting before Obama's visit to Cuba. Netanyahu had planned to visit Washington this month not only to meet with Obama but also to speak at the annual conference of AIPAC, a prominent pro-Israel lobby group in the U.S. In the past, he had addressed the group through satellite communication. The prime minister had previously delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing the Iran nuclear deal last March and had been denied a meeting with Obama during that visit, which was widely seen as a diplomatic slight. However, the two leaders did meet at the White House in November in an attempt to repair their strained relationship. Disagreements over defense aid have continued to strain ties, with Netanyahu and his team suggesting that Israel could wait for the next U.S. president to secure a more favorable agreement if no deal is reached with Obama. The current U.S. defense aid to Israel, amounting to around $3 billion annually, is set to expire in 2018, and efforts are being made to extend it before Obama's term ends in January 2017. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently on a five-day visit to the Middle East, is scheduled to visit Israel later this week to hold discussions with Netanyahu."}

It showed signs of organization by September 13, prompting the National Hurricane Center to monitor it closely for potential development. On September 17, Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from this wave, located 350 miles (560 km) east of Barbados. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Philippe later that day, with forecasts correctly predicting a northward track, keeping it away from the Lesser Antilles, despite historical trends suggesting otherwise.\nPhilippe continued to strengthen steadily, reaching hurricane status late on September 18 under favorable conditions with low wind shear. There were initial indications that Philippe might escalate to a major hurricane, but it encountered higher wind shear from a non-tropical low associated with Hurricane Rita's outflow. Consequently, Philippe's winds peaked at 80 mph (130 km/h) before regressing to a tropical storm on September 20.\nAs Philippe moved northward, bypassing the low pressure area, its weakening persisted. The forecast failed to anticipate this decline, partially due to models hinting at a potential re-strengthening to hurricane status.

Nonetheless, the island experienced gusty winds and precipitation, with 0.15 inches (3.8 mm) reported on September 23. The circulation absorbed by Philippe brought light rainfall to the island and caused the lowest barometric pressure recorded during the month.\nWhen Tropical Storm Philippe materialized on September 17, it set a new record as the earliest 16th storm in a season, surpassing the previous 1933 season record by 10 days."}

Alice originated on May 25 in the western Caribbean, following a large loop over Central America, passing through western Cuba with significant rainfall that may have resulted in several drownings. It then undertook another loop in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching its peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) before making landfall on the Florida panhandle on June 6. Despite the heavy rainfall in Florida, the storm caused minimal damage.\n\n= = Meteorological Background = =\n\nDuring May and June 1953, an extended upper-level low pressure system lingered over Mexico and Central America. On May 25, a weak warm-core surface circulation formed east of Nicaragua, moving around the upper-level low in a northwestern direction before looping southwards through Honduras and Central America. Although the system weakened over land, it regained strength over the western Caribbean Sea, eventually passing over western Cuba as a 50 mph (80 km/h) tropical storm on May 31. Official advisories for Alice began on June 1 as it entered the Gulf of Mexico.\nAround the time the storm was named, reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of approximately 65 mph (105 km/h), following which Alice executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. Interaction with a cold front off Florida caused the storm to rapidly weaken to minimal tropical storm status. Consequently, advisories were discontinued, with meteorologist James George from the Miami Weather Bureau stating that there was \"no imminent danger.\" After another pass near the Cuban coast, Alice turned northwestward, intensifying once more. By June 5, reconnaissance aircraft estimated winds of 70 to 75 mph (110 to 120 km/h) in brief squalls northeast of the center, marking its peak intensity. As Alice approached the Florida peninsula, it weakened again and eventually made landfall west of Panama City Beach on June 6 before dissipating.\n\n= = Impacts and Historical Significance = =\n\nWhile near western Cuba, Alice brought heavy rainfall that ended a nine-month drought, resulting in flooding and unverified reports of drowning incidents. Upon the initiation of storm advisories, the National Hurricane Center issued storm warnings from Key West through Tarpon Springs on Florida's west coast and small craft warnings for the east coast up to Palm Beach. The storm caused substantial rainfall in Florida, peaking at 13.48 inches (342 mm) in Lake Placid in the central region of the state. The rain broke the dry spell, prompting precautions such as securing aircraft at local Air Force and Naval bases along the Florida panhandle. Despite no evacuation orders, the main impact was limited to light rainfall, with no damage reports in the state.\nFrom 1950 to 1952, Atlantic hurricanes were designated using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. In 1953, the naming system shifted to using female names, with Alice being the inaugural storm named under the new format. Male names were not introduced until 1979. The name \"Alice\" was subsequently reused twice in 1954 for hurricanes in June and December, as well as for a hurricane in 1973."}
{"src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday released a government form dealing with contacts he has had with foreign nationals, including Russian government officials, but much of it was redacted. Form SF-86, required for government employees working in national security, indicated Sessions has had no immediate contact with any foreign government or its representatives in the past seven years. However, Sessions has said he met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A large portion of the document was left blank. “As a United States Senator, the Attorney General met hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign dignitaries and their staff. In filling out the SF-86 form, the Attorney General’s staff consulted with those familiar with the process, as well as the FBI investigator handling the background check, and was instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his Senate activities,” said Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior. Sessions released the form in response to a lawsuit filed by American Oversight, a group that advocates for government transparency and sued DOJ in April after the extent of Sessions’ contact with the Russian government was called into question.  Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said the form was evidence that Sessions lied to the FBI investigators overseeing his security clearance. “Jeff Sessions is our nation’s top law enforcement officer, and it is shocking one of his first acts after being named Attorney General was to lie to the FBI on an issue of national security,” Evers said.  Sessions recused himself from the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the election after media reports revealed he held undisclosed meetings with Kislyak. Sessions admitted to having the interactions, but said they were held in his capacity as a U.S. senator, a position he occupied for 20 years before becoming attorney general.  Former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May, testified that his agency had information on Sessions that would lead them to believe his continued involvement in the federal probe would be “problematic.” It was later reported that Sessions had another undisclosed interaction with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington in April 2016. Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had no recollection of the interaction.

However, Sessions acknowledged meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A substantial section of the form remained incomplete. The Justice Department's spokesperson, Ian Prior, mentioned that as a Senator, Sessions had numerous encounters with foreign dignitaries and their staff. When completing the SF-86 form, Sessions' team sought advice from experts and the FBI investigator managing the background check, being advised not to include meetings related to his Senate responsibilities. The form was shared in response to a lawsuit by American Oversight, a transparency advocacy group, following concerns about Sessions' connections with the Russian government. Executive director Austin Evers accused Sessions of deceiving FBI investigators overseeing his security clearance. Despite Sessions' admission to the undisclosed Kislyak meetings, stating they occurred during his Senate tenure of 20 years prior to becoming Attorney General, he recused himself from the federal investigation into Russian election interference. Former FBI Director James Comey indicated that the agency had information on Sessions that raised concerns about his involvement in the federal probe. Reports surfaced about an additional undisclosed interaction between Sessions and Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in April 2016, which Sessions claimed not to remember during his testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.
