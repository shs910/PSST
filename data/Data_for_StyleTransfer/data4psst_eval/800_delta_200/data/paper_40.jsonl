Equivalent\ntransformations of the Lagrangian do change the momentum. In field theories,\ngauge transformations are special cases of such transformations. The electric\nfield E is gauge invariant, but its capacity of being the canonical momentum is\nnot. \" The wrong emphasis as summarized by G.K{\\'o}nya al. would be: \"The use\nof the canonical coordinate\/momentum pair A p and E in Poincar{\\'e} gauge is\npresented as mandatory in Rousseau and Felbacq paper, whereas as there is a\ncertain freedom of choice in selecting this pair.

The HI\nextends for a total of ~15kpc. The data, combined with a titled-ring model of\nthe disk, allow to conclude that the kinematics of the HI is that of a\nregularly rotating, highly warped structure down to the nuclear scale. The\nparameters (in particular the inclination) of our model are somewhat different\nfrom some of the previously proposed models but consistent with what was\nrecently derived from stellar light in a central ring. The model nicely\ndescribes also the morphology of the dust lane as observed with Spitzer. There\nare no indications that large-scale anomalies in the kinematics exist that\ncould be related to supplying material for the AGN. Large-scale radial motions\ndo exist, but these are only present at larger radii r>6kpc). This unsettled\ngas is mainly part of a tail\/arm like structure. The relatively regular\nkinematics of the gas in this structure suggests that it is in the process of\nsettling down into the main disk. The presence of this structure further\nsupports the merger\/interaction origin of the HI in Cen A. From the structure\nand kinematics we estimate a timescale of 1.6-3.2*10^{8}yr since the merging\nevent. No bar structure is needed to describe the kinematics of the HI. The\ncomparison of the timescale derived from the large-scale HI structure and those\nof the radio structure together with the relative regularity of the HI down to\nthe sub-kpc regions does not suggest a one-to-one correspondence between the\nmerger and the phase of radio activity. Interestingly, the radial motions of\nthe outer regions are such that the projected velocities are redshifted\ncompared to the regular orbits. This means that the blueshifted absorption\ndiscovered earlier and discussed in our previous paper cannot be caused by\nout-moving gas at large radius projected onto the centre. Therefore, the\ninterpretation of the blueshifted absorption, together with at least a fraction\nof the redshifted nuclear absorption, as evidence for a regular inner disk,\nstill holds. Finally, we also report the discovery of two unresolved clouds\ndetected at 5.2 and 11kpc away (in projection) from the HI disk.

The model is based on the Point\nDefect Model (micro scale) and an update of the model on the friction process\n(micro-macro scale). Genetic algorithm was used for finding solution of the\nproblem. The major results are, as expected from experimental results, albumin\nprevents from degradation at the lowest concentration of chlorides; an\nincubation time is necessary for degrading the passive film; under fretting\ncorrosion and high concentration of chlorides the passive behavior is\nannihilated.\n  Les implants orthop\\'ediques de hanche ont une dur\\'ee de vie d'environ 15\nans. Par exemple, la tige f\\'emorale d'un tel implant peut \\^etre r\\'ealis\\'ee\nen acier inoxydable 316L ou 316LN. Le fretting corrosion, frottement sous\npetits d\\'eplacements, peut se produire pendant la marche humaine en raison des\nchargements r\\'ep\\'et\\'es entre le m\\'etal de la proth\\`ese et l'os.

{"input":"  Cells have evolved a metabolic control of DNA replication to respond to a\nwide range of nutritional conditions. Accumulating data suggest that this\npoorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon\nMetabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA)\nis intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises\na catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to\nproduce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function.\nInterestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is\nhomologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a\nconserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and\ncatalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in\nreplication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown\nin a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth.\nMeasurements of replication parameters ( ori\/ter ratio, C period and fork\nspeed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit\nreplication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein\nrather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and\nPEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively\nand negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a\nprocess depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues\nbinding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and\nbelonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of\nPykA in replication. In vitro , PykA affects the activities of replication\nenzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for\ninitiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA . Our results thus\nconnect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and\nADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and\nthe replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed\nwith a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling\nmetabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the\ncellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication\ninitiation and elongation to metabolism. This defines a new type of replication\nregulator proposed to be part of the metabolic control that gates replication\nin the cell cycle.\n","num_tokens":701,"num_sentence":13}

We used\nGSWLC to trace the dependence of these SFR calibrators with redshift.

{"input":"  Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL\/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

Assuming a large predominance\nof Lya-emitting AGN\/QSOs in our samples, this supports the scenario by which\nthese are the most abundant class of z>2 Lya emitters at L_Lya>10^43.3 erg\/s.\n","num_tokens":666,"num_sentence":11}
{"input":"  We present early science results from the First Large Absorption Survey in HI\n(FLASH), a spectroscopically blind survey for 21-cm absorption lines in cold\nhydrogen HI gas at cosmological distances using the Australian Square Kilometre\nArray Pathfinder (ASKAP). We have searched for HI absorption towards 1253 radio\nsources in the GAMA 23 field, covering redshifts between $z = 0.34$ and $0.79$\nover a sky area of approximately 50 deg$^{2}$. In a purely blind search we did\nnot obtain any detections of 21-cm absorbers above our reliability threshold.\nAssuming a fiducial value for the HI spin temperature of $T_{\\rm spin}$ = 100 K\nand source covering fraction $c_{\\rm f} = 1$, the total comoving absorption\npath length sensitive to all Damped Lyman $\\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs; $N_{\\rm HI}\n\\geq 2 \\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$) is $\\Delta{X} = 6.6 \\pm 0.3$ ($\\Delta{z} =\n3.7 \\pm 0.2$) and super-DLAs ($N_{\\rm HI} \\geq 2 \\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) is\n$\\Delta{X} = 111 \\pm 6$ ($\\Delta{z} = 63 \\pm 3$). We estimate upper limits on\nthe HI column density frequency distribution function that are consistent with\nmeasurements from prior surveys for redshifted optical DLAs, and nearby 21-cm\nemission and absorption. By cross matching our sample of radio sources with\noptical spectroscopic identifications of galaxies in the GAMA 23 field, we were\nable to detect 21-cm absorption at $z = 0.3562$ towards NVSS J224500$-$343030,\nwith a column density of $N_{\\rm HI} = (1.2 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{20} (T_{\\rm\nspin}\/100~\\mathrm{K})$ cm$^{-2}$. The absorber is associated with GAMA\nJ22450.05$-$343031.7, a massive early-type galaxy at an impact parameter of 17\nkpc with respect to the radio source and which may contain a massive ($M_{\\rm\nHI} \\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$) gas disc.
