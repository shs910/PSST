        "src_passage": "= M @-@ 42 ( Michigan highway ) =\n\nM @-@ 42 is a rural state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan . It is located in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of the state . Along its route , M @-@ 42 begins in Manton and ends north of Lake City , some 10 @.@ 356 miles ( 16 @.@ 666 km ) apart . The highway used to run much farther . Former termini included the Traverse City area from 1919 until 1940 and Mesick from 1940 until 2007 .\n\n= = Route description = =\n\nM @-@ 42 is a rural , two @-@ lane highway connecting Manton and Lake City . It runs through wooded terrain on gently rolling hills . Between the western terminus at Michigan Avenue and the US 131 freeway in Manton , M @-@ 42 is concurrently designated with Bus . US 131 along Seventh Street . It runs east along Seventh Street to a folded diamond interchange at Exit 191 on US 131 east of downtown . Continuing east , it is known as North 16 Â½ Road until it crosses the Wexford â Missaukee county line at Seeley Road approximately 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) east of the freeway . Here the road name changes to Mike and Tony Road before M @-@ 42 curves southeasterly crossing Morrisy Creek on West Walker Road . East of the unincorporated community of Arlene the highway turns ninety degrees to the south off Walker Road before angling southeasterly skirting the edge of some hills near Dyer Lake just west of M @-@ 66 . The road turns back due east between Al Moses Road and M @-@ 66 , where it ends north of Lake City . No section of the trunkline is part of the National Highway System .\n\n= = History = =\n\nM @-@ 42 is an original state trunkline dating back to the 1919 signage of the highway system in Michigan . The original highway routing started at M @-@ 13 in Manton and ran due west to Mesick . From there the highway turned north and met M @-@ 11 at Chums Corners . M @-@ 11 / M @-@ 42 ran concurrently northward into the City of Traverse City where M @-@ 42 ended . By May 1929 , M @-@ 42 was extended east to connect to Lake City . The highway was further extended before 1936 up the Old Mission Peninsula north of Traverse City . In the latter half of 1940 , the M @-@ 37 designation replace M @-@ 42 north of Mesick through Traverse City to Old Mission . The last sections of highway were paved in late 1951 and early 1952 .\nIn 2007 , the stretch of M @-@ 42 between M @-@ 37 and US 131 along 16 Road was transferred to the Wexford County Road Commission . This change shortened the highway from 25 @.@ 255 miles ( 40 @.@ 644 km ) to 10 @.@ 356 miles ( 16 @.@ 666 km ) . The section of transferred highway in Wexford County was labeled as \" flexible pavements \" on the 2006 MDOT Truck Operators Map . This classification meant truck traffic on the roadway was subject to weight and load restrictions during spring . This classification is unlike the other highways in the county and surrounding area which were marked as \" all @-@ weather highways \" and would not carry such restrictions .\n\n= = Major intersections = =\n\n\n",

We used a spectro-astrometry analysis to identify\nhigh-velocity (> 300 km/s) molecular gas disconnected from the galaxy rotation,\nwhich we attribute to outflows. In 77% of the 26 nuclei with $\\log\nL_{IR}/L_{\\odot}>11.8$, we identifid molecular outflows with an average\n$v_{out}= 490$ km/s, outflow masses $1-35 \\times 10^7$ $M_{\\odot}$, mass\noutflow rates $\\dot{M}_{out}=6-300$ $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, mass-loading factors\n$\\eta = \\dot{M}_{out}/SFR = 0.1-1$, and an average outflow mass escape fraction\nof 45%. The majority of these outflows (18/20) are spatially resolved with\nradii of 0.2-0.9 kpc and have short dynamical times ($t_{dyn}=R_{out}/v_{out}$)\nin the range 0.5-2.8 Myr. The outflow detection rate is higher in nuclei\ndominated by starbursts (SBs, 14/15=93%) than in active galactic nuclei (AGN,\n6/11=55%). Outflows perpendicular to the kinematic major axis are mainly found\nin interacting SBs. We also find that our sample does not follow the\n$\\dot{M}_{out}$ versus AGN luminosity relation reported in previous works. In\nour analysis, we include a sample of nearby main-sequence galaxies (SFR =\n0.3-17 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) with detected molecular outflows from the\nPHANGS-ALMA survey to increase the $L_{IR}$ dynamic range. Using these two\nsamples, we find a correlation between the outflow velocity and the SFR, as\ntraced by $L_{IR}$ ($v_{out} \\propto SFR^{0.25\\pm0.01})$, which is consistent\nwith what was found for the atomic ionised and neutral phases. Using this\ncorrelation, and the relation between $M_{out}/R_{out}$ and $v_{out}$, we\nconclude that these outflows are likely momentum-driven.\n",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has decided to scrap a program shielding from deportation immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children but will give Congress six months to craft legislation to replace it, sources familiar with the situation said. The president decided to delay enforcement of his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the two sources said on Sunday. One source cautioned that the president could change his mind. The decision to give Congress half a year to come up with a an alternative, first reported by Politico, represents a  compromise of sorts after top Republicans and business leaders  asked Trump to keep the program. DACA, an Obama administration policy, protects nearly 800,000 young men and women often called “Dreamers” from deportation and allows them to work legally.  Dreamers are a fraction of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of them Hispanic. Trump as a candidate promised to deport all of them, but many Americans have rallied to support the young adults who have spent large parts of their lives in the United States. The decision, to be announced on Tuesday, will seek to placate both sides in the immigration debate at a time when the president is also grappling with North Korea’s nuclear program and Houston’s recovery from Hurricane Harvey. As a candidate, Trump pledged to immediately scrap the program but he ran into stiff opposition. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged Trump on Friday not to rescind the program and was joined by Senator Orrin Hatch, also a Republican. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from Florida tweeted her dismay with the decision to scrap DACA: “After teasing #Dreamers for months with talk of his ‘great heart,’ @POTUS slams door on them. Some ‘heart’.” That said, Trump’s base will likely be far from happy about the president’s decision to leave open the option of a fix. Representative Steve King, a hawk on immigration and Iowa Republican, tweeted his opposition to the plan on Sunday night. Democrats, like Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, also wanted the program to continue. Franken called the reported decision a “disgrace.” Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat, last week asked Ryan to meet with Democratic lawmakers to discuss a “comprehensive legislative solution.” Leading business figures defended the Dreamers, including  Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and Facebook Inc (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who signed a letter to the president outlining the economic contribution of Dreamers. Prior to the news of Trump’s action, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook tweeted, “250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them.”  But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin downplayed those warnings on Sunday, telling Fox News Sunday he was “less concerned about the economic impact.” Most of the Dreamers came from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. More than 200,000 live in California, while 100,000 are in Texas. New York, Illinois and Florida also have large numbers. Congress under presidents of both parties has been unable to pass comprehensive immigration reform. What to do about Dreamers has been actively debated within the White House and Trump administration. One senior administration official described the debate as a “tug of war” between factions. DACA supporters argue that the people it protects grew up and are U.S. educated and integrated into American society, with little connection to the countries in which they are citizens. Opponents of the program argue that illegal immigrants take jobs from U.S. citizens. ",

        "src_passage": "BEIJING (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump left Beijing on Friday for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, first lady Melania stayed behind to play tourist, viewing pandas at a zoo and visiting the Great Wall of China. At the Beijing Zoo, the 47-year-old former model fed a giant panda named Gu Gu and learned about his nutrition and training.  She greeted a group of school children waving miniature Chinese and American flags, handing out stuffed toy eagles after watching the children sing a Chinese folk song at the panda enclosure.  Thank you very much,  she said. Melania then signed a panda print, writing:  Thank you to the Beijing Zoo! Wonderful to meet Gu Gu! Melania Trump . Later in the afternoon, Melania walked along part of the Mutianyu section of the more than 20,000-km (12,400-mile) long Great Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where China frequently takes visiting heads of state and their spouses. As with previous first ladies, Melania has used her platform to champion public causes, such as the prevention of childhood bullying and combating the opioid epidemic in the United States. Playing a prominent supporting role on the president s multi-leg Asia visit, she won praise on Chinese social media, with comparisons to China s glamorous first lady, Peng Liyuan, and comments on her apparent ease in navigating the ancient cobblestones of the Forbidden City in super-high stilettos upon arrival in Beijing on Wednesday. Accompanied by Peng, Melania watched a cultural performance, painted pandas and participated in a cooking class at a primary school on Thursday.     Many on China s Twitter-like Weibo applauded Melania s grace and sense of style, as well as her cultural sensitivity.   In China, she wore mostly austere coats and dark gowns from Dolce & Gabbana and Alexander McQueen, in contrast with her magenta Delpozo outfit and electric-blue heels upon landing in South Korea days before.  But most in China said they remained bigger fans of their own first lady, often affectionately referred to online as Peng Mama, which roughly translates as Mother Peng.  I still think Mama oozes more grace, while also exuding a motherly air!  one Weibo poster said. Chinese social media sites are policed more heavily than normal during important political events, with negative or sensitive matter swiftly blocked or removed by internet censors.  As Trump departed, he said on Twitter his wife s next stop would be Alaska, where she would  greet our AMAZING troops . However, Trump s daughter and adviser Ivanka, who is very popular in China, did not accompany her father, to the disappointment of fans. ",

        "src_passage": "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena (Reuters) - One of humanity s most isolated outposts joined the 21st century on Saturday when the British island of St. Helena, home to  the world s most useless airport , welcomed its first commercial flight. As the inaugural plane from Johannesburg touched down on the forbidding volcanic outcrop in the middle of the south Atlantic, the travel and history buffs on board clapped and cheered.  I ve never felt so emotional in all my life,  said Libby Weir-Breen, a British travel operator who has been bringing tourists to the island, 1,200 miles (1,900 km) west of the African nation of Angola, for the last 12 years. She had flown in specially from Scotland to be on the plane, and dabbed away tears as it touched down on the spectacular cliff-side runway.  I never thought I d see this day,  she said.  The 4,500 people living on St. Helena, a British colony since 1658 - most famous as the windswept outpost where French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte breathed his last - might also be forgiven for thinking the day would never come. There has been talk of building an airport on St. Helena since the 1930s. The best site   one of the few flat spaces on the notoriously craggy island   was ruled out because of a nearby breeding ground for the wirebird, an endangered species of plover. An airport at the new site, on top of a valley filled in with 8 million cubic meters of rock, suffered numerous setbacks and delays as costs ballooned to 285 million pounds, to the horror of the British government. The runway and terminal were completed in 2016 but the official opening was pushed back another year after test flights were buffeted by wicked cross-winds, making it unsafe for large aircraft to use. With Britain mired in financial austerity, the London media were quick to condemn it as a white elephant, or  the world s most useless airport , with a price tag of more than 60,000 pounds for every Saint, as the island s residents are known. Before the opening of the airport, which will receive weekly flights to and from the South African commercial capital, the only way to St. Helena was a five-night voyage from Cape Town aboard the RMS St. Helena, a British postal ship. With the risk of wind-shear limiting the size of planes and numbers of passengers   Saturday s flight had room for 100 but only 68 on board due to weight restrictions   the hoped-for tourist boom is unlikely to materialize. Hotel capacity has jumped in the last few years from just a few dozen rooms to more than 100, but, with a maximum of 3,500 visitors a year, the island is unlikely to be weaned off the 53 million pounds it receives in aid every year from London. Besides Napoleon s old house, Longwood, and a cemetery holding some of the 6,000 Afrikaner prisoners sent there by the British during the Anglo-Boer wars in South Africa, St. Helena offers scuba diving and walking in pristine natural wildernesses. Governor Lisa Phillips dismissed the critics and said that even before it accepted its first commercial flight, the airport had proved its worth in the last 18 months by enabling several life-saving emergency medical evacuations, including a newborn child.  I ve seen the headlines about the world s most useless airport, but for St. Helenans this has already been the most useful airport,  she told reporters after greeting them on the tarmac.  It s priceless.  ",

        "src_passage": "= Tropical Storm Alice ( 1953 ) =\n\nTropical Storm Alice was the first tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean to receive a female name . It was a rare off @-@ season tropical cyclone that hit Central America , Cuba , and Florida in late May to early June 1953 . Alice formed on May 25 in the western Caribbean , and executed a large loop over Central America . It passed over western Cuba , causing heavy rainfall and possibly several casualties from drowning . It then executed another loop in the Gulf of Mexico , reached a peak intensity of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , and weakened before hitting the Florida panhandle on June 6 . Although heavy rainfall occurred in Florida , there was little damage .\n\n= = Meteorological history = =\n\nIn May and June 1953 , an unusually long @-@ lasting upper @-@ level low persisted across Mexico and Central America . On May 25 , a weak warm @-@ core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua . It moved around the upper @-@ level low , bringing it to the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America . The system weakened over land , but it re @-@ intensified over the western Caribbean Sea , moving over western Cuba as a 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) tropical storm on May 31 . Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1 , when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico .\nAround the time the cyclone 's naming , reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of around 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) , and subsequently Alice executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba . Alice weakened quickly to minimal tropical storm status , due to interaction with a cold front off Florida . It deteriorated so much that advisories were discontinued , with Miami Weather Bureau meteorologist James George remarking that \" no danger [ existed there ] whatsoever . \" After again passing near the Cuban coast , Alice turned to the northwest and began re @-@ strengthening . On June 5 , reconnaissance aircraft estimated 70 to 75 mph ( 110 to 120 km / h ) winds in brief squalls northeast of the center , along with a pressure of 997 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) ; this would be its peak intensity . The storm again weakened as it approached the Florida peninsula , and Alice made landfall just west of Panama City Beach on June 6 as a minimal tropical storm . It dissipated shortly thereafter .\n\n= = Impact and records = =\n\nWhile the storm was in the vicinity of western Cuba , it produced heavy rainfall , which broke a nine @-@ month drought . The rainfall caused flooding , and there were unconfirmed reports of several deaths due to drowning .\nWhen advisories first began on the storm , the National Hurricane Center issued storm warnings from Key West through Tarpon Springs on the west coast of Florida ; at the same time , the agency posted small craft warnings for the east coast up through Palm Beach . Alice brought heavy rainfall to Florida , peaking at 13 @.@ 48 inches ( 342 mm ) in Lake Placid in the central portion of the state . The rains ended a dry spell in the state . Along the Florida panhandle , workers tied down planes in local Air Force and Naval bases . No evacuations were ordered , and the primary impact was in the form of light rain . There were no reports of damage in the state .\nFrom 1950 to 1952 , Atlantic hurricanes were named using the Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet . Before the 1953 season , officials changed the system to using female names ; hence , Alice was the first in the new format . Male names would not be used until 1979 . The name \" Alice \" was later reused twice in 1954 for a hurricane in June and December , as well as for a hurricane in 1973 .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Cooperation between China and the United States will lead to a win-win outcome for both sides, but confrontation will bring mutual losses, China said on Tuesday, after the United States branded it a competitor seeking to challenge U.S. power. China hopes the United States can abandon its mentality of zero-sum games and seek common ground while respecting differences, China s U.S. embassy said on its website.  On the basis of mutual respect, China is willing to exist peacefully with other countries including the United States,  it said.  But the U.S. ought to adapt to, and accept, China s development.  China has always been a contributor to global development and a protector of the international order, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said later in Beijing.       Cooperation is the only correct choice for China and the United States,  she said, adding that it was not surprising for the two to have disagreements but that they should find constructive ways to handle them. China s economic and diplomatic activities around the world are broadly welcomed and no country or report will succeed in distorting the facts or deploying malicious slander, she told a daily news briefing. As the world s two largest economies, China and the United States have a responsibility to protect global peace and stability and promote global prosperity, Hua added.  We urge the U.S. side to stop intentionally distorting China s strategic intentions.  In a new national security strategy based on U.S. President Donald Trump s  America First  vision on Monday, the United States lumped China and Russia together as competitors seeking to erode U.S. security and prosperity.                The singling out of China and Russia as  revisionist powers  comes despite Trump s own attempts to build strong relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the two sides seek to rein in North Korea s nuclear and missile programs. The new U.S. strategy reflects an unwillingness to accept the reality of China s rise, the state-run Global Times said in an editorial.   But because of the enormous size and strength China has already achieved, they won t be able to suppress China,  the widely-read newspaper said. However, Trump was basically reiterating his standard line on China rather than threatening any specific action, said Shi Yinhong, head of the Centre for American Studies at Beijing s Renmin University.  Since he took office the Chinese government s line on Trump has always been: Don t really look at what he says, but look at what he does,  said Shi, who has advised the government on diplomacy.  So the strong words against China in the report the Chinese government won t really care about.   A senior U.S. administration official said China was attempting to revise the global status quo through its aggression in the South China Sea.  China says its expansion of islets in the South China Sea is for peaceful purposes only and it can, in any case, do what it wants, as it has irrefutable sovereignty there. The U.S. administration also warned that intellectual property theft by China was a national security problem. ",

It was the third of the University Boat Races to be held on the Thames , between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge .

Nevertheless , Cambridge won the race by three @-@ quarters of a length to lead the overall record at 3 â 1 .\n\n= = Background = =\n\nThe Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the \" Dark Blues \" ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the \" Light Blues \" ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and takes place on the River Thames in southwest London .\nFollowing heavy defeats in the 1836 and 1839 races , and in order to improve the selection of the crew , Oxford University Boat Club was formed on 23 April 1839 , to which anyone at the university could subscribe and which was governed by the various college boat club captains . The initial letter of challenge was delivered to Cambridge from Oxford in February . After considerable discussion , mainly about the restriction of crew selection to undergraduates only , the date of the race , 15 April 1840 , was agreed sixteen days prior to the race itself . The umpires for the race were Calverley Bewicke ( for Oxford ) and Charles Jasper Selwyn ( for Cambridge ) , while W. H. Harrison , the Commodore of the Royal Thames Yacht Club , was the referee . The race was to take place on a five @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 2 km ) stretch of the Thames between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge .\n\n= = Crews = =\n\nThe Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 10 @.@ 5 lb ( 74 @.@ 4 kg ) per rower , 2 @.@ 5 pounds ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) more per man than their opponents .

Walls .\n\n= = Race = =\n\nOxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex side of the river , handing the Surrey side to Cambridge . The race commenced from below Westminster Bridge at 1.30pm , with Edward Searle acting as the starter . With a number of steamers blocking the route , Oxford made a good start and took an early lead . The wake of the steamers caused rough water in which both crews struggled to maintain a consistent rhythm . The lead had extended by the time the crews passed below Vauxhall Bridge and was nearly three lengths by the Spread Eagle pub . At this point Cambridge began to reduce the deficit , but following a warning from Robert Coombes who was steering the umpire 's boat Dolphin , Oxford 's cox Garnett steered across the path of Cambridge . The Light Blues maintained their course and Oxford were forced back again . By the Red House , Cambridge had restored parity and started to pull away . Despite suffering further rough water from the wake of another steamer at Battersea Bridge , Cambridge maintained their lead and passed through the centre arch of Putney Bridge three @-@ quarters of a length ahead of Oxford . The winning time was 29 minutes 3 seconds , and the victory took the overall lead to 3 â 1 in favour of Cambridge .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "MARSEILLE, France/PARIS (Reuters) - Two women were stabbed to death and their assailant shot dead by a soldier in the southern French port city of Marseille on Sunday in what officials described as a  likely terrorist act . Police sources said the suspect had shouted  Allahu Akbar  (God is greatest) in Arabic as he attacked the women, aged 17 and 20, at Marseille s main railway station. Two police sources said one had her throat slit while the other was stabbed in the chest and stomach. An Islamic State militant was responsible for the attack, the group s Amaq news agency said. The assailant was shot dead by a soldier from a military Sentinelle patrol, a force deployed across the country as part of a state of emergency declared after Islamist attacks that began almost two years ago.  We have until now managed to avoid such dramatic incidents (in Marseille). I think it was a terrorist attack and the individual who was killed seems to have had several identities,  Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin told reporters. Paris was rocked in 2015 by multiple attacks that killed 130 people. In 2016 a gunman drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86 people. Both of these attacks were claimed by Islamic State. Other countries, including Britain, Germany and Belgium, have also suffered attacks by militants using knives, guns, explosives and driving vehicles at crowds. Some 200 police officers cordoned off the area and all roads were closed to traffic. A witness told Reuters she saw a man take out a knife from his sleeve and then stab a young girl and then a second woman, shouting what could have been  Allahu Akbar . Speaking in Marseille, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the man had initially killed one woman and looked to be running away before returning to attack a second woman and then rush toward soldiers from the Sentinelle force who arrived on the scene quickly and shot him dead. Two police sources said the attacker had been carrying a butcher s knife, was around 30 years old and of North African appearance. One source said he was known to police for common law crimes, while another said digital analysis of fingerprints had come up with several aliases.  This could be an act of terrorism, but we cannot confirm it fully at this stage,  Collomb told reporters. French troops are part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa fighting al Qaeda-linked militants, operations that have made these groups urge their followers to target France. Security forces have increasingly been targeted by militants in knife attacks. A man wielding a knife attacked a soldier in a Paris metro station on Sept. 15. President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter he was  disgusted by this barbaric act  and praised the calmness and efficiency of security forces. French lawmakers are due to vote on a much-criticized anti-terrorism law on Tuesday, which would see France come out of its state-of-emergency in November, although some of the powers would be enshrined into law. The number of military personnel on the ground is also due to be reduced slightly, although the force is being adapted to make it more mobile and its movements less predictable.  The presence of Sentinelle soldiers, their speed and efficiency ensured that the death count was not bigger,  police union official Stephane Battaglia told Reuters. ",

        "src_passage": "= Surface diffusion =\n\nSurface diffusion is a general process involving the motion of adatoms , molecules , and atomic clusters ( adparticles ) at solid material surfaces . The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface , as in figure 1 . Just as in bulk diffusion , this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature . Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest @-@ neighbor jumps . Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen has been shown to diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect .\nVarious analytical tools may be used to elucidate surface diffusion mechanisms and rates , the most important of which are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy . While in principle the process can occur on a variety of materials , most experiments are performed on crystalline metal surfaces . Due to experimental constraints most studies of surface diffusion are limited to well below the melting point of the substrate , and much has yet to be discovered regarding how these processes take place at higher temperatures .\nSurface diffusion rates and mechanisms are affected by a variety of factors including the strength of the surface @-@ adparticle bond , orientation of the surface lattice , attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients . It is an important concept in surface phase formation , epitaxial growth , heterogeneous catalysis , and other topics in surface science . As such , the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries . Real @-@ world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters , integrated circuits used in electronic devices , and silver halide salts used in photographic film .\n\n= = Kinetics = =\n\nSurface diffusion kinetics can be thought of in terms of adatoms residing at adsorption sites on a 2D lattice , moving between adjacent ( nearest @-@ neighbor ) adsorption sites by a jumping process . The jump rate is characterized by an attempt frequency and a thermodynamic factor that dictates the probability of an attempt resulting in a successful jump . The attempt frequency Î½ is typically taken to be simply the vibrational frequency of the adatom , while the thermodynamic factor is a Boltzmann factor dependent on temperature and Ediff , the potential energy barrier to diffusion . Equation 1 describes the relationship :\n<formula>\nWhere Î½ and Ediff are as described above , Î is the jump or hopping rate , T is temperature , and kB is the Boltzmann constant . Ediff must be smaller than the energy of desorption for diffusion to occur , otherwise desorption processes would dominate . Importantly , equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature . The manner in which diffusion takes place is dependent on the relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor : when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion . This case , known as mobile diffusion , is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems . For the phenomena described throughout this article , it is assumed that Ediff > > kBT and therefore Î < < Î½ . In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the Î½ and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient , D , versus 1 / T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present ( see below ) , there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature .\nRandom walk statistics describe the mean squared displacement of diffusing species in terms of the number of jumps N and the distance per jump a . The number of successful jumps is simply Î multiplied by the time allowed for diffusion , t . In the most basic model only nearest @-@ neighbor jumps are considered and a corresponds to the spacing between nearest @-@ neighbor adsorption sites . The root mean squared displacement goes as <formula> ( eq . 2 ) . The diffusion coefficient is given as D",

        "src_passage": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s ruling ANC decided to downgrade its embassy in Tel Aviv to a liaison office over a U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, ahead of a U.N. vote on Thursday on a resolution urging Washington to drop the move.  The decision was taken at the end of a five-day African National Congress conference, in which Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as its new leader and South Africa s likely next president after 2019 elections, following Jacob Zuma.  Delegates endorsed the proposal that we must give practical support to the oppressed people of Palestine and resolved on an immediate and unconditional downgrade of the SA (South Africa) Embassy in Israel to a Liaison Office,  new ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule said on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from Israel s Foreign Ministry. South Africa s ministry for international relations and cooperation said on its website that it was deeply concerned about Trump s move as it would undermine Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, which has been frozen since 2014. The South African Board of Jewish Deputies and the South African Zionist Federation jointly condemned the ANC s decision. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will hold a rare special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states to vote on the draft resolution, which Washington vetoed on Monday in the 15-member U.N. Security Council.     Most countries regard the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be settled in an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, although that process has been frozen for over three years. Israel deems Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.  The ANC s move comes at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pursuing closer ties with other African countries. Last month, on a visit to Kenya, Netanyahu announced that Israel was opening a new embassy in nearby Rwanda  as part of the expanding Israeli presence in Africa and the deepening of cooperation between Israel and African countries . Israel is seeking to expel thousands of African migrants to Rwanda. On Thursday, Netanyahu described the United Nations as a  house of lies  on Thursday and said Israel  totally rejects this vote, even before approval . Trump upended decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab and Muslim world, and concern among Washington s Western allies. When under white-minority rule, South Africa was one of Israel s few allies on the continent. But after the 1994 demise of apartheid, relations cooled as the black-majority ANC took over. The ANC has condemned Israeli occupation of territories where Palestinians seek statehood, while maintaining full diplomatic and trade relations with Israel. ",

        "src_passage": "(Reuters) - Scientists may steal a page from the oil industry’s playbook to stop President Donald Trump rewriting the U.S. position on climate change, by relying on an obscure law meant to ensure federal agencies present accurate information. The 2001 Information Quality Act, passed under Republican President George W. Bush, has for years provided a way for companies and their lobbyists to challenge federal agencies’ assumptions on issues ranging from the threats posed by global warming to the health effects of petrochemicals. Now, as Trump’s leadership seeks to get the Environmental Protection Agency into line with the new administration’s more pro-business and anti-regulation agenda, the act could become a tool for rebellious scientists and climate advocates, legal experts said. Trump has expressed doubts about the science behind climate change, putting his administration on a collision course with an overwhelming majority of scientists who believe that human consumption of fossil fuels is warming the planet and triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms. A spokesman for Trump’s EPA said last week that the agency’s website is under review, raising worries of a rewrite that could put the site at odds with EPA employees’ own research. A Trump administration official did not respond to a request for comment. “Posting blatantly false information on the EPA’s website would violate the Information Quality Act,” said Romany Webb, a climate law fellow at Columbia University. “The guidelines clearly state that information disseminated to the public, including via a website, must be substantively accurate.” Michael Halpern, deputy director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit climate science advocacy group, said the Information Quality Act could be one of the options scientists consider using to ensure federal agencies match scientific research. The Information Quality Act allows individuals who object to information presented by a federal agency to request a correction. If the agency denies the request, the individual can appeal in a process overseen by an independent inspector general. In the case of the EPA, the appeal would go to a panel of political appointees – who will likely be named after Trump’s pick to head the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is confirmed. The EPA’s Inspector General, however, is already in place: Arthur Elkins, a former EPA lawyer appointed by Barack Obama in 2010. “We have discretionary authority to look at anything we think is important and valuable to the agency’s activities,” Alan Larsen, counsel to the Inspector General, told Reuters. “If employees were asked to do something improper ... they could bring that to the IG’s office.” The Washington Post reported this week that a member of the Trump transition team had sent an email stating inspectors general across federal agencies were being held over on a “temporary basis.” After some backlash, Trump transition team members then sought to reassure the inspectors general they would not be forced out, the Post reported. There are other ways employees can flag their concerns, including by complaining to the agency’s Scientific Integrity Officer. The Scientific Integrity Office meets quarterly with the Inspector General’s office to discuss complaints. Industry’s use of the Information Quality Act over the years has had mixed results. Just five of the 20 requests for correction filed in 2014 ended up fully or partially corrected, according to a report to Congress. Halpern said, however, that he expected better results if scientists file complaints rather than industry.  Overruling a correction request brought by scientists within the agency, he said, could violate the EPA’s scientific integrity policy, which states agency scientists have the right of last review over information that relies on their expertise. A former EPA official who asked not to be named said that, under normal circumstances, the internal mechanisms to protect website accuracy should work, but added “we’re in uncharted territory.”",

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning on Thursday questioned Barack Obama’s legacy after the former Democratic president commuted her sentence last week, and she called for “an unapologetic progressive leader” to fight for minorities’ rights. While not mentioning U.S. President Donald Trump by name, Manning wrote in Britain’s the Guardian that “after eight years of attempted compromise and relentless disrespect in return, we are moving into darker times” and urged Democrats not to compromise.  Trump responded in a tweet, calling her a traitor and criticizing the decision to release her.  “Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!” Trump wrote.      Manning had been sentenced to 35 years in prison after   committing the biggest breach of classified information in American history in 2010 by handing over U.S. government secrets to anti-secrecy group Wikileaks.   In one of his final actions before leaving office last week, Obama commuted Manning’s sentence to about seven years, allowing it to end on May 17. Republicans, including Trump’s spokesman, criticized the commutation as a dangerous precedent for leakers. Obama has defended the move, saying Manning had served a tough sentence and that justice had been served. He also said it was unrelated to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s pledge to accept extradition to the United States, where there is an open criminal investigation into the group’s activities, if Manning was freed. Wikileaks, in its own tweet on Thursday, rejected Trump’s assertion as “wrong,” noting that Manning was found not guilty of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy.  Manning, formerly known as U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning, was born male but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman. She has struggled to cope as a transgender woman in a men’s military prison and last year twice tried to kill herself. In her Guardian piece, she did not directly acknowledge Obama’s commutation. Instead, Manning said the former president compromised too much and left a “vulnerable legacy” with “very few permanent accomplishments.”  She raised concerns about worsening healthcare, increased criminalization of racial minorities and “queer and trans people,” and she urged political progressives to prepare to dig in and push for “change at every level.”  “The one simple lesson to draw from President Obama’s legacy: Do not start off with a compromise. They won’t meet you in the middle. Instead, what we need is an unapologetic progressive leader.”  ",

        "src_passage": "= Tops in Science Fiction =\n\nTops in Science Fiction was a science fiction magazine which was launched in 1953 . The publisher , Love Romances Publishing , created it as a vehicle to reprint stories from Planet Stories . It was unsuccessful and only lasted for two issues . Although it contained no original stories , it did print some original artwork , including some of Kelly Freas 's early work . A British reprint edition appeared in the mid @-@ 1950s .\n\n= = Publication history = =\n\nThe early 1950s saw dramatic changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing . At the start of 1949 , all but one of the major magazines in the field were in pulp format ; by the end of 1955 , almost all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format . Despite the rapid decline of the pulp market , several new science fiction magazines were launched in pulp format during these years ; Tops in Science Fiction was one of the last of these . The publisher , Love Romances Inc . , also published Planet Stories , and Malcolm Reiss , Planet 's editorial director , decided to try to take advantage of the backfile of stories and artwork from Planet 's 14 years of publication . He may have been inspired by the example of Fantastic Story Magazine , which was published by Standard Magazines as a vehicle to reprint their extensive backfile of science fiction . If so , he was evidently not aware that by 1953 Fantastic Story was not doing well financially .\nThe first issue was dated Spring 1953 , and was edited by Jack O 'Sullivan . The cover , by Alexander Leydenfrost , was reprinted from a 1942 issue of Planet Stories . The fiction included \" Black Friar of the Flame \" by Isaac Asimov , and \" The Million Year Picnic \" , by Ray Bradbury â the first of his \" Martian Chronicles \" stories . Interior art included some of Kelly Freas ' earliest work . The issue was only modestly successful , and on the advice of his distributor , who told Reiss that they were having trouble getting the magazine distributed , Reiss decided to switch to the digest format for the second issue : digests were starting to become more popular than the pulps , which would be almost completely gone from the market within only a couple more years . The second issue was dated Fall 1953 ; the cover , by Freas , illustrated \" Lorelei of the Red Mist \" , by Bradbury and Leigh Brackett . Freas also did the interior illustrations for the story , and later commented that he was delighted by the results but felt he was \" never quite able to repeat it . A hex , of course . \" Interior artists for the second issue also included Emsh ; the fiction included stories by Fredric Brown and Horace Gold . However , this issue received only limited distribution , and Reiss decided against continuing with the magazine .\n\n= = Bibliographic details = =\n\nTops in Science Fiction 's two issues were dated Spring and Fall 1953 ; the first in pulp format , and the second a digest . There was a single volume of two numbers . The publisher was Love Romances Publishing , based in Stamford , Connecticut . The magazine was priced at 25 cents for the pulp issue , and 35 cents for the digest issue . Both issues were 128 pages long . The first issue was edited by Jack O 'Sullivan ; the second by Malcolm Reiss .\nA British reprint edition appeared , with three 128 @-@ page digest editions published by Top Fiction Ltd . These were released in Autumn 1954 , Winter 1955 and Summer 1956 , though none of them were dated . The first two reprinted stories from the first U.S. issue ; the third reprinted material from the second U.S. issue . They were each priced at 1 / 6 .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "  We use the Dirac equation with a ``(asymptotically free) Coulomb + (Lorentz\nscalar) linear '' potential to estimate the light quark wavefunction for $\nq\\bar Q$ mesons in the limit $m_Q\\to \\infty$. We use these wavefunctions to\ncalculate the Isgur-Wise function $\\xi (v.v^\\prime )$ for orbital and radial\nground states in the phenomenologically interesting range $1\\leq v.v^ \\prime\n\\leq 4$. We find a simple expression for the zero-recoil slope, $\\xi^ \\prime\n(1) =-1/2- \\epsilon^2 <{r_q}^2>/3$, where $\\epsilon$ is the energy eigenvalue\nof the light quark, which can be identified with the $\\bar\\Lambda $ parameter\nof the Heavy Quark Effective Theory. This result implies an upper bound of\n$-1/2$ for the slope $\\xi^\\prime (1)$. Also, because for a very light quark $q\n(q=u, d)$ the size $\\sqrt {<{r_q}^2>}$ of the meson is determined mainly by the\n``confining'' term in the potential $(\\gamma_\\circ \\sigma r)$, the shape of\n$\\xi_{u,d}(v.v^\\prime )$ is seen to be mostly sensitive to the dimensionless\nratio $\\bar \\Lambda_{u,d}^2/\\sigma$.

        "src_passage": "  We compared the properties of 56 elliptical galaxies selected from three\nclusters at $1.2<z<1.4$ with those of field galaxies in the GOODS-S (~30),\nCOSMOS (~180) and CANDELS (~220) fields. We studied the relationships among\neffective radius, surface brightness, stellar mass, stellar mass density\n$\\Sigma_{Re}$ and central mass density $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ within 1 kpc radius. We\nfind that cluster ellipticals do not differ from field ellipticals: they share\nthe same structural parameters at fixed mass and the same scaling relations. On\nthe other hand, the population of field ellipticals at $z\\sim1.3$ shows a\nsignificant lack of massive ($M_*> 2\\times 10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$) and large (R$_e\n> 4-5$ kpc) ellipticals with respect to the cluster. Nonetheless, at\n$M*<2\\times 10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$, the two populations are similar. The size-mass\nrelation of ellipticals at z~1.3 defines two different regimes, above and below\na transition mass $m_t\\sim 2-3\\times10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$: at lower masses the\nrelation is nearly flat (R$_e\\propto M_*^{-0.1\\pm 0.2}$), the mean radius is\nconstant at ~1 kpc and $\\Sigma_{Re}\\sim \\Sigma_{1kpc}$ while, at larger masses,\nthe relation is R$_e\\propto M*^{0.64\\pm0.09}$. The transition mass marks the\nmass at which galaxies reach the maximum $\\Sigma_{Re}$. Also the\n$\\Sigma_{1kpc}$-mass relation follows two different regimes,\n$\\Sigma_{1kpc}\\propto M*^{0.64\\ >m_t}_{1.07\\ <m_t}$, defining a transition mass\ndensity $\\Sigma_{1kpc}\\sim 2-3\\times10^3$ M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. The mass density\n$\\Sigma_{Re}$ does not correlate with mass, dense/compact galaxies can be\nassembled over a wide mass regime, independently of the environment. The\ncentral mass density, $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$, besides to be correlated with the mass,\nis correlated to the age of the stellar population: the higher the central\nstellar mass density, the higher the mass, the older the age of the stellar\npopulation.

        "src_passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers are questioning whether Heritage Pharmaceuticals misled them in response to a 2014 congressional inquiry about the rising price a common antibiotic, after 20 U.S. states this week accused the company of price fixing. In a Dec. 16 letter to Heritage seen by Reuters, Maryland Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings and Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders said they feared the company was “disingenuous at best” in October 2014 when it told them it had not seen any significant price increases for its doxycycline hyclate product. “We are very concerned that you made these assertions to Congress on behalf of Heritage during the exact time period that its executives were engaged in a price fixing scheme to prevent competition from driving down prices of doxycycline hyclate,” they wrote. In response to Friday’s letter, the company said it does not make the same version of doxycycline hyclate that the lawmakers asked about in 2014. Heritage makes a delayed release version, not the immediate release version that was the subject of the 2014 inquiry. Heritage said it explained this to the lawmakers in its 2014 response. The letter to Heritage comes after criminal and civil charges were filed by the Justice Department and 20 states in connection with an alleged price fixing scheme involving doxycycline hyclate and glyburide, a diabetes drug. On Wednesday, the Justice Department criminally charged Heritage’s former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Glazer and former Heritage Vice President of Commercial Operations Jason Malek, accusing them of colluding with other generic manufacturers in schemes that entailed allocating market share and conspiring to raise prices. The next day, 20 states filed a parallel civil lawsuit against Heritage, along with Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mayne Pharma Group, Citron Pharma and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., saying they colluded to fix prices. The lawsuit characterized Heritage as the “ringleader,” with Glazer and Malek overseeing and running the scheme. Mylan and Teva have previously denied the states’ civil charges. Sanders and Cummings launched a congressional inquiry into rising generic drug prices on Oct. 2, 2014, including the price of doxycycline hyclate.  As part of that, they sent a letter to Glazer while he was still CEO of Heritage to inquire about the prices. Gary Ruckelshaus, who was then Heritage’s outside counsel and now serves as vice president and general counsel, responded later that month and said Heritage “has not seen any significant price increases” for the drug.

        "src_passage": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria’s political opposition hopes Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election next week because she has a better understanding of the conflict than Donald Trump, according to members of a delegation holding talks at the United Nations. Khaled Khoja and Hind Kabawat, in Geneva on Monday to press for U.N.-led negotiations on the release of Syrian detainees, said they trusted Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State, to deliver on the opposition’s top priority - protecting civilians. Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” on the ground in Syria to protect non-combatants. Trump says this could “lead to World War Three” due to the potential for conflict with Russia, which is providing military support to President Bashar al-Assad. Kabawat said Trump, who has never held public office and has no foreign policy experience, saw Islamic State, also known as ISIS, as the only alternative to Assad in Syria.  “For us a woman’s leadership at this time would be a good thing. Also for many, like Trump and others, they think that the Syrian conflict is comparing Assad with ISIS and they have to take one side or the other, and of course for them Assad will look more prominent than ISIS,” said Kabawat.  “She (Clinton) knows that is wrong. She knows that there is this moderate opposition that believes in democracy and freedom. This is what we are aiming for, to have a president of the U.S. with good experience who knows the difference between the different oppositions.” Assad, whose forces have regained much territory against their opponents with the help of Russian warplanes, has branded all those opposed to his rule as “terrorists”.  Trump has said defeating Islamic State should be a higher priority than trying to persuade Assad to step aside, a departure from a long-held U.S. policy objective. Khoja, leading the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva, disagreed with this viewpoint. “Dealing with only the ISIS issue will not help with solving the crisis in Syria or the region because the root cause of the crisis is the (Assad) regime itself,” he said. Kabawat, an attorney and a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, added that the Syrian political opposition wanted to see women playing an equal role to men in the nation’s politics. The opposition delegation, which has links to the Free Syrian Army but not with Islamic State or al Qaeda-linked groups, is in Geneva this week to revive the issue of prisoner releases, sidelined during months of fruitless peace talks. Khoja said more than 100 armed groups had shown their willingness to cooperate but there had been no sign of cooperation from Assad’s government or Russia, adding that the United Nations should form a committee on the matter. “If it’s needed, if there is a response from the regime side to release the detainees and stop killings inside Syria, then we can have the representative of the military groups also in this committee, and if the regime wants to send someone to this committee, we can discuss it,” Khoja said.  The Syrian Network of Human Rights has documented more than 90,000 detainees held by the Syrian government, 6,000 held by Islamic State and 2,400 held by the rest of the opposition, but estimates the real numbers are twice as high.

        "src_passage": "EDMONTON, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada defended its immigration and refugee vetting system on Monday after a Somali immigrant, who had drawn scrutiny for his alleged extremist views, was charged with attempted murder for a weekend vehicle and knife attack that injured five. Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, is accused of running down a police officer with his car in Edmonton, Alberta, and then stabbing him repeatedly. He then ran down four pedestrians during an attempt to evade capture. Sharif faces 11 charges including five for attempted murder linked to the rampage in the western Canadian city on Saturday night and police said more charges could be laid. He came to Canada in 2012 and was granted refugee status in the same year, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said.  Though targeted in a probe two years ago for promoting extremist ideology, Sharif was deemed to pose no threat after what the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) described on Sunday as an  exhaustive investigation.      Goodale said it would be wrong to blame the attack on any shortcomings in Canada s immigration and refugee vetting system.  There s absolutely no evidence of that whatsoever. The investigation is ongoing, but that conclusion is just not supported by the facts,  Goodale told reporters in Ottawa.  Still, the attack could leave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau open to more criticism from conservatives for the welcoming message he extended to refugees earlier this year, after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries. Canada has seen a surge in illegal border crossings this year as people fearing a U.S. immigration crackdown and possible deportation sought asylum.  Opposition Conservative parliamentarian Michelle Rempel said the incident raised questions about how police and immigration officials share information.  If there are gaps in the system that allowed this to happen, what are we going to do to fix those?  Rempel asked in comments to Reuters.  Edmonton s refugee and Somali communities are bracing for a  backlash in the wake of the attack, and met on Monday to discuss how to move forward, said Ahmed Abdulkadir, executive director of the Ogaden Somali Community of Alberta.   We ve been receiving phone calls from moms asking us what to do  and whether it s safe to send their children to school, Abdulkadir said.  Sharif s bail hearing was delayed until Tuesday but police released a photo of Sharif taken after his capture, showing a young man gazing directly at the camera, a large bruise on his forehead.   Karen King, one of Sharif s neighbors in an Edmonton, said he kept to himself and lived alone. Another, Jeff Dearman, said he played loud music and chanted sometimes.  It was all normal other than that,  Dearman said.  Two of the four people injured on Saturday remained in hospital, with one listed in serious condition, RCMP Superintendent Stacey Talbot told a news conference. Despite the incident, Canada s government said it was keeping the terrorism threat level at medium, where it has been since late 2014 after two deadly attacks attributed to homegrown radicals. The incidents led to tougher new anti-terrorism measures.  In October, 2014, a gunman killed a soldier at Ottawa s national war memorial before launching an attack on the Canadian Parliament. In the same week, a man ran down two soldiers in Quebec, killing one. ",

        "src_passage": "  In this work we provide algorithmic solutions to five fundamental problems\nconcerning the verification, synthesis and correction of concurrent systems\nthat can be modeled by bounded p/t-nets. We express concurrency via partial\norders and assume that behavioral specifications are given via monadic second\norder logic. A c-partial-order is a partial order whose Hasse diagram can be\ncovered by c paths. For a finite set T of transitions, we let P(c,T,\\phi)\ndenote the set of all T-labelled c-partial-orders satisfying \\phi. If N=(P,T)\nis a p/t-net we let P(N,c) denote the set of all c-partially-ordered runs of N.\nA (b, r)-bounded p/t-net is a b-bounded p/t-net in which each place appears\nrepeated at most r times. We solve the following problems:\n  1. Verification: given an MSO formula \\phi and a bounded p/t-net N determine\nwhether P(N,c)\\subseteq P(c,T,\\phi), whether P(c,T,\\phi)\\subseteq P(N,c), or\nwhether P(N,c)\\cap P(c,T,\\phi)=\\emptyset.\n  2. Synthesis from MSO Specifications: given an MSO formula \\phi, synthesize a\nsemantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N satisfying P(c,T,\\phi)\\subseteq\nP(N, c).\n  3. Semantically Safest Subsystem: given an MSO formula \\phi defining a set of\nsafe partial orders, and a b-bounded p/t-net N, possibly containing unsafe\nbehaviors, synthesize the safest (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N' whose behavior lies\nin between P(N,c)\\cap P(c,T,\\phi) and P(N,c).\n  4. Behavioral Repair: given two MSO formulas \\phi and \\psi, and a b-bounded\np/t-net N, synthesize a semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t net N' whose\nbehavior lies in between P(N,c) \\cap P(c,T,\\phi) and P(c,T,\\psi).\n  5. Synthesis from Contracts: given an MSO formula \\phi^yes specifying a set\nof good behaviors and an MSO formula \\phi^no specifying a set of bad behaviors,\nsynthesize a semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N such that\nP(c,T,\\phi^yes) \\subseteq P(N,c) but P(c,T,\\phi^no ) \\cap P(N,c)=\\emptyset.\n",

The road starts at Tsing Tsuen Road , where it travels through the northern part of the island . It ends at Route 3 and Route 8 on the western side of the island at a left @-@ in / left @-@ out interchange , 2 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) from its eastern terminus . The road was first planned in 1998 to relieve traffic coming from Lantau . It was constructed in 1999 , and was opened in February 2002 .\n\n= = Description = =\n\nThe road starts at the border of the Tsing Ma Control Area , on the eastern exit ramps of the Tam Kong Shan Interchange and the western terminus of Tsing Tsuen Road . The road travels westward , with ramps reemerging from the interchange , which is surrounded by noise barriers . TYNCR then travels across multiple viaducts on the northern side of Tsing Yi , with hills south of the road , and the coastline north of it . About 1 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 87 mi ) from the eastern terminus , TYNCR travels to Tam Kong Shan Road , near a shipyard and a cement factory . The exit ramp is accessible from westbound lanes , and the entrance ramp from Tam Kong Shan Road to eastbound lanes . The road continues eastward and ends at a left @-@ in / left @-@ out intersection , located east of the Lantau Link Visitors Centre . The interchange then connects to Routes 3 and 8 .\nIn 2014 , 15 @,@ 240 vehicles traveled the road between Tam Kong Shan Road interchange and Tsing Tsuen Road . It is measured in average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which measures the amount of traffic daily on average . The road is classified as a District Distributor by the Transport Department .\n\n= = History = =\n\nPlanning for the road began around 1996 , as part of the Tsing Ma Control Area , a small region of highways with special management . The road was to relieve the higher traffic traveling through Tsing Yi , especially with the new Hong Kong International Airport and developments in Lantau being built . The project included the road and its ramps , pedestrian pathways , noise barriers around the highway , surveillance system , and a maintenance centre in Tsing Yi . The Highways Department signed a contract with Gammon Construction Limited for HKD $ 775 @.@ 6 million in February 1999 , after it invited qualified contractors in October 1998 . Construction began later that month .\nDuring construction , techniques were used to prevent air pollution . Water was sprayed on roads , vehicles , and other areas to keep dust from leaving the site . Multiple viaducts , road embankments , and retaining walls were constructed in the project , with a set of walls replaced after its footings were damaged . Construction of the traffic control system began in November 2000 , after the Transport Department signed an agreement with ABB Industrial and Building Systems Limited . The road was opened on February 2 , 2002 , after Donald Tsang inaugurated the road in a ceremony on February 1 . New speed limits were set to 70 kilometres per hour ( 43 mph ) upon opening .\n\n= = Major intersections = =\n\nThe entire road is in Kwai Tsing District .\n\n",

        "src_passage": "= Ãthelred ( bishop ) =\n\nÃthelred ( or Ethelred ; died 30 June 888 ) was an Anglo @-@ Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in medieval England . Although one source states that he was Bishop of Wiltshire prior to his elevation to Canterbury , this has been shown to be false . Much of Ãthelred 's time in office was spent dealing with the dislocations caused by the invasion of England by Vikings . There were also conflicts with King Alfred the Great over ecclesiastical matters as well as the desire of the papacy to reform the English clergy .\n\n= = Biography = =\n\nSome sources , including the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , in the F version of that work , state that Ãthelred was transferred in 870 from the Bishopric of Wiltshire to the see of Canterbury . However , the transfer has now been proven to be taken from the life of Ãlfric of Abingdon , who was archbishop from 995 to 1005 . Although the story of his transfer is false , Ãthelred was consecrated as archbishop in 870 . Why he was selected for Canterbury is unknown , as there is no contemporary information on his election .\nMost of Ãthelred 's time as archbishop was spent dealing with the effects of Viking raids , but he also had a conflict with King Alfred the Great over royal control of ecclesiastical affairs . It was during Ãthelred 's archbishopric that the Golden Gospels , a still @-@ surviving 8th century gospel book , was ransomed from a raiding army and donated to Canterbury . Pope John VIII also urged Ãthelred and Archbishop Wulfhere of York to reform the dress of the English clergy . The Anglo @-@ Saxon clergy wore the short tunic that was the normal costume of the laypeople of Britain . The Roman custom , however , was to wear long clerical robes or habits , and the Anglo @-@ Saxon custom was opposed by the papacy and other continental clergy . Whether Ãthelred and Wulfred took steps to try to change the dress of their clergy is unknown , but the clothing customs of the Anglo @-@ Saxon clergy did not change .\nAround 877 , Ãthelred wrote to Pope John VIII to complain about King Alfred 's conduct towards Canterbury . The exact nature of the dispute is not clear , but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists . The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect the rights of the archbishop . The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred , which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Ãthelred . Other historians , however , do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time .\nÃthelred also reached an agreement with Ãlfred , an ealdorman , where Ãlfred was granted the life use of a Canterbury estate in return for bequeathing one of his estates to Canterbury after his death . The document that records this agreement is not dated , however , so it is unknown when exactly during Ãthelred 's episcopate the document was drawn up . Another problem for the archbishop was a decline in the abilities of the scribes at Canterbury , which is dramatically illustrated by the document , which has a number of errors and duplications . Other documents of the period show that some of the scribes had little knowledge of Latin .\nÃthelred died 30 June 888 .\n\n",

We identify 18 member stars in Car II, including\n2 binaries with variable radial velocities and 2 RR Lyrae stars. The other 14\nmembers have a mean heliocentric velocity $v_{\\rm hel} = 477.2 \\pm 1.2$ km/s\nand a velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_v = 3.4^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$ km/s. Assuming Car\nII is in dynamical equilibrium, we derive a total mass within the half-light\nradius of $1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.4} \\times 10^{6} M_\\odot$, indicating a mass-to-light\nratio of $369^{+309}_{-161} M_\\odot/L_\\odot$. From equivalent width\nmeasurements of the calcium triplet lines of 9 RGB stars, we derive a mean\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] = $-2.44 \\pm 0.09$ with dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]} =\n0.22 ^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$. Considering both the kinematic and chemical properties,\nwe conclude that Car II is a dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. For Car III,\nwe identify 4 member stars, from which we calculate a systemic velocity of\n$v_{\\rm hel} = 284.6^{+3.4}_{-3.1}$ km/s. The brightest RGB member of Car III\nhas a metallicity of [Fe/H] $= -1.97 \\pm 0.12$. Due to the small size of the\nCar III spectroscopic sample, we cannot conclusively determine its nature.\nAlthough these two systems have the smallest known physical separation ($\\Delta\nd\\sim10~kpc$) among Local Group satellites, the large difference in their\nsystemic velocities, $\\sim200$ km/s, indicates that they are unlikely to be a\nbound pair. One or both systems are likely associated with the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC), and may remain LMC satellites today. No statistically significant\nexcess of $\\gamma$-rays emission is found at the locations of Car II and Car\nIII in eight years of Fermi-LAT data.\n",
